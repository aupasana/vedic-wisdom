Dear Aswin,

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 As Rajarshi ji said, it is a kind of mind-=
stream. Manas, Buddhi, Chitta and Ahamkara travel along, as the soul manife=
sts in another womb. Subtle body is a part of the package where karmas are =
embedded. But these are only theoretical knowledge and is not of much help.=
 

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 A little bit of reasoning on Brahman or Maya is=
 useful to understand the point intellectually. That helps in discriminatin=
g between the good and bad. The rest are only details.

Theoretically speaking apart from the soul, it is the mind-s=
tream that lives beyond death and reincarnates in a suitable body based on =
vasanas and karmas. It is here that the desires, karmas, etc are stored.

I=
n another perspective, the soul is a particular state of awareness I guess.=
 When one is able to reach there, then and only then does one 'discover' th=
e Atma. Constant identification with that state is being in the Atmah.

ople also, I am cc'ing it to the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. I am doing it wit=

son he is not the karman,atma<br>> cannot be polluted,realising this san=
kara went to the queen&thus he is still as sacred<br>> as ever?<br>&=
nbsp;<br>Though correct, this is a dangerous notion for most people. True, =
atma cannot be poluted and is beyond desires and actions. But most people d=
o not identify with atma. They
 identify with a perishable body. So all the=
 talk of "all is atma and atma is pure" is just theory.<br> <br>Atma i=
s like an ocean in which waves and rippes arise and move. Ocean does not ge=
t shattered when ripples hit each other and stays the same. But bodies, min=
ds and other perishable objects arising in atma are like waves and ripples =
arising and moving in ocean. They increase, decrease, get shattered etc. On=
e identifying with the ocean of atma is beyond happiness and sadness. One i=
dentifying with the ripple of a body will experience happiness, sadness etc=
.<br> <br>Suppose one is watching a movie and knows that it is not rea=
l and just a movie. Still, when a really scary scene comes, one may be star=
tled. Mere intellectual understanding that it is not real and just a movie,=
 is not enough. It has to be ingrained fully in one's instincts. Similarly,=
 intellectually knowing that all this is a play and not real, is not enough=
. When some really
 pleasurable and painful event happens, one WILL identif=
y with the body and experience something.<br> <br>If Shankara was full=
y enlightened before that episode (we don't know that for sure), then the a=
ction would not have bound him. Otherwise, it would've created a rina. If h=
e experienced some pleasure, he would create a new rina to the queen, to va=
rious deities (!) who live within one's consciousness and operate various p=
arts of one's body and mind, and to various beings in his virya who may hav=
e been significantly affected. He would have to pay those debts back later.=
<br> <br>*        *  &nbs=
p;     *<br> <br>There is nothing absolutely sacre=
d or dirty about any action. It is the intent and attitude of the actor tha=
t makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered actions are more dirty tha=
n selfless actions geared at others. More so, the denser and more selfish o=
ne's
 conditioning. <br> <br>*      &nbs=

ing this still he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do<br>> th=
is for love or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?<br> <br>On=
ly still ocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Similarly only =
ummanifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new srishti/crea=
tion) does not have any objects and actions within it. Atma during a srisht=
i cycle does have many objects within it and many actions between them.<br>=
 <br>Thus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest and =
doing nothing. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized person=
 identifies with atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like hi=
s/her actions. One does not particularly identify with what one's old body =
specifically does (based on previous momentum).<br> <br>Nature uses
 s=
uch realized people to set good examples for the world. So they do engage i=
n some actions. They have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and do=
 whatever spontaneously occurs to them.<br> <br>Shankara performing la=
st rites for mother would've made Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an e=
xample for future. One's interaction with the world is give & take. We =
give things to others and take things from them. True renunciation is in re=
nouncing what we take. There is no need to renounce giving. As the prevant =
notion of sannyasa was to cut off from the world, Shankara demonstrated giv=
ing others (e.g. mother) sannyasa.<br> <br>Swami Vivekananda and Swami=
 Sivananda took this further. They engaged in a lot of service for the soci=
ety, unlike other sannyasis who lock themselves in isolation.<br> <br>=
Of course, if the act of "giving" increases pride (i.e. you are "taking" so=
mething in return of what you are giving!!!), then a sannyasi
 better isola=
te oneself from the world and neither give nor take (except absolute essent=
ials for survival). But, when one progresses beyond some level, it is a goo=
d idea to "give" what one is in a position to give others.<br> <br>The=
 purpose of life is to give and not to take, though some taking is unavoida=
ble in the process of giving. Focus on what you give and not on what you ta=
