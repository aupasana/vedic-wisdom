Dear Narasimha,

Your are right. The evolution of gunas makes logical sense=
.

<<BTW, what you say of "external experiences" applies to "internal 
expe=
riences" as well. After all, mind (especially an imaginative one) is capabl=
e of "manufacturing" over time whatever it fancies. Some 
experiences can b=
e hallucinations. Even when not, they can reinforce 
some unneeded conditio=
ning. I am not just talking about beginners, but 
even highly evolved sadha=
kas.>>

One more delusion that many sadhakas face is the belief that they a=
re somehow special, and therefore they know more. Maybe they prayed for xyz=
 and it happened and that reinforces a subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle e=
go that they are indeed something! What they probably fail to realize is th=
at, anyone who has done some sufficient sadhana, and gone to some depth wou=
ld invariable have experienced some similar and/or apparently miraculous th=
ings, irrespective of the path or the deity. As a parameter for judgement s=
piritual depth, it does not mean much. 

-Regards

=C2=A0 
Nama=
ste Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
What you are describing is essentially evolution of gu=
nas. What you call first stage is dominated by tamas, with some rajas too. =
What you call the second stage is dominated by rajas, with some tamas too. =
What you call the third stage is dominated by satta, with some rajas too.
=
=C2=A0
This can be further broken down as follows:
=C2=A0
(1) Mostly tamas:=
 Does not think about spiritual sadhana or progress. May fear god and go to=
 temple or see/do poojas now and then.
(2) Mostly tamas, with some rajas: E=
ngages in some sadhana. But the ignorance and attachments bring fears, worr=
ies, anxieties, doubts etc. As tamas reduces and rajas increases, doubts an=
d fears are allayed to some extent, some direction is found and there is mo=
re focused effort.
(3) Mostly rajas, some tamas: Engages in a lot of sadhan=
a, but still has some misconceptions and doubts in mind. As tamas reduces, =
doubts and misconceptions reduce.
(4) Mostly rajas, some sattwa: Engages in=
 a lot of sadhana and focus and clarity of thinking starts to set in. As sa=
ttwa increases, one's thinking, vision and focus become clearer.
(5) Mostly=
 sattwa, some rajas: Weaknesses that troubled earlier start to trouble less=
 and there is mental clarity. There is still some passion, attachment and r=
esultant internal stress (i.e. resisting divine will or the fruits of previ=
ous karmas), which reduces as rajas reduces.
(6) Mostly sattwa: Clear visio=
n, nice focus of mind in sadhana, very good acceptance of divine will (frui=
ts of previous karmas) and flowing with the divine rhythm.
=C2=A0
There can=
 be several other abstractions to look at stages in sadhana. Vasishtha desc=
ribes some in Yoga Vaasishtham.
=C2=A0

=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
One importan=
t thing to note is that sadhana and spiritual progress are not something to=
 flaunt. If one is in stage 2 or 3, it is nothing to be ashamed of and one =
need not pretend otherwise. The most important thing is to be honest intern=
ally. If there are doubts and anxieties, there is no point in suppressing t=
hem. They should be addressed in the earnest. A proper and natural evolutio=
n of understanding comes with time to everyone. Pretensions of being someon=
e one is not and forceful suppression of misunderstandings does not help in=
 the long run.
=C2=A0
Secondly, one need not spend a fixed amount of time i=
n each stage. Some people make fast progress and some people take more time=
. If God wills, one can become liberated in a second. So don't worry wherev=
er you are in terms of these "stages".

=C2=A0
BTW, w=
hat you say of "external experiences" applies to "internal experiences" as =
well. After all, mind (especially an imaginative one) is capable of "manufa=
cturing" over time whatever it fancies. Some experiences can be hallucinati=
ons. Even when not, they can reinforce some unneeded conditioning. I am not=
 just talking about beginners, but even highly evolved sadhakas.
=C2=A0
For=
 example, there have been several elevated yogis claiming to be the reincar=
nations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. They may all have genuinely believed it=
 and not trying to deceive anyone. If one's mind nurtured a secret desire t=
o be somebody important and if one likes Ramakrishna, it is possible to exp=
erience an internal vision suggesting that one is a reincarnation of Ramakr=
ishna.
=C2=A0
Let me give a subtler example. I was once discussing the mean=
ing of "Mantra Pushpam" here (see http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=
m/message/7015). A learned yogi wrote to me that it was about denser elemen=
ts dissolving in lighter elements as Kundalini ascends and denser elements =
coming back from lighter elements as Kundalini descends. When I pointed out=
 weaknesses in that interpretation, he told me that that was the *vision* (=
internal experience) he got when he meditated with it. However, that absolu=
tely does not add up. What is described in Mantra Pushpam is not chain of X=
 merging in Y, Y merging in Z, etc. Moreover, all elements are not covered.=
 Moreover, water is common, i.e. X lies in water, water lies in X; Y lies i=
n water, water lies in Y, and so on. That is different from dissolution and=
 creation of elements as happens when Kundalini ascends and descends.
=C2=
=A0
However, I can believe that that yogi may have indeed gotten the vision=
 as he claimed. When one looks at a verse (or any other notion or idea), on=
e's rational mind may consciously or sub-consciously come up with an intell=
ectual understanding. If an imaginative and focused mind meditates then, it=
 may indeed experience a corresponding vision! It is all a play of mind and=
 of no significance. Not every internal experience of even an elevated yogi=
 who genuinely experienced aspects of divine (but not yet liberated) may me=
an something.
=C2=A0
Knowing which internal experience is a result of some =
conditioning, some desire or some rational/emotional notion still present i=
n the mind, is not easy, even for good and sincere sadhakas.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
External and internal experiences cannot be avoided as one =
does sadhana. Depending on one's conditioning, one may experience many thin=
gs.
=C2=A0
Whether an experience is external or internal is not IMHO the ma=
in thing. Both can be useful in some cases and increase faith and confidenc=
e or give clarity of thinking, and trigger positive internal transformation=
. Both can be detrimental in some cases and increase pride or reinforce som=
e wrong notions, and delay positive internal transformation or even trigger=
 negative internal transformation.
=C2=A0
Vasishtha's guidance is very clea=
r. Neither seek nor avoid experiences (which are like roadside trees as one=
 travels on a hilly road to the top of the hill). Keep the mind focused on =
sadhana to the best of your ability.
=C2=A0
Though I said it before, I will=
 say this again, because it is worth saying many times:
=C2=A0
The only wor=
thwhile measure of spiritual progress and the only experience worth longing=
 is the internal experience of detachment. If one experiences less stress i=
n situations that would've stressed one before, if one experiences less ang=
er in situations that would've angered one before, if one experiences less =
lust in situations that would've made one lusty before, if one experiences =
less jealosy in situations that would've made one jealous before, and so on=
, then one is making progress.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

Three stages of sadhana, as I see it. Purely my own observati=
ons. Not points of debate. Everyone is free to disagree. 

1st stage of Sad=
hana: Try out scoops of everything, hanging on to solicited or unsolicited =
advice from anywhere and everwhere, and eventually moving in confused circl=
es, feeling proud and happy about the fact that, yes I am doing something c=
alled sadhana while many others are not. The mind lies in the communal stag=
e (communal =3D anyone one who mentally identifies to a community not neces=
sarily in a religious sense), trying to find a community of similar minded =
individuals and hang on to the same in a subconscious attempt to define its=
elf. 

2nd stage of Sadhana: Get bits and pieces of "experiences" in an ext=
ernal format which the mind correlates to the process of sadhana and either=
 feels happy, or dejected. Soon it gets boring, for none of these so called=
 external "experiences" are consistent or even replicable at will. Doubts s=
tart creeping, boredom sets in, confusions galore, and some fall back to st=
age 1 described above. 

3rd stage: One realizes the absolute futility of t=
he external experiences compared to what is happening inside, if at all any=
thing is happening. Until a transformation process triggers inside the mind=
, all of it is meaningless. The external world may crack open and 33 millio=
ns deities may dance infornt, yet it eventually counts for nothing if it is=
 not able to still the "monkey-mind" and make the sadhaka enjoy a concentra=
ted feeling of internal joy. This joy will overflow into other secular acti=
vities and thoughts, it's so powerful and dynamic in nature. One who is fir=
mly established in this stage, will never bother too much about the externa=
l ritual, its source, its accuracy etc. He/she does not shun external ritua=
ls, but he/she realizes that the real barometer for judging the efficacy of=
 a sadhana is inside the mind and heart. This is the beginning of the "alon=
e" phase. Alone, but not lonely. In loneliness one craves for external vali=
dation, in being
 alone one needs no validation apart from his/her own joy.=
 

As such, if this person were to meet another sadhaka, the only worthy in=
formation he/she will try to extract is what has the other person experienc=
ed internally, and be least bothered about what path he/she walks and which=
 deity he/she is trying to worship. Fancy names and theoretical classificat=
ions do not impress him/her anymore. 

>From here starts the real journey. B=
efore that, stage 1 and stage 2 is like a kindergarten attitude. So each sa=
dhaka must ask himself/herself objective, where does he/she stand and where=
 is he/she headed!

e important thing to note is that sadhana and spiritual progress are not so=

f and one need not pretend otherwise. The most important thing is to be hon=
est internally. If there are doubts and anxieties, there is no point in sup=
pressing them. They should be addressed in the earnest. A proper and natura=
l evolution of understanding comes with time to everyone. Pretensions of be=
ing someone one is not and forceful suppression of misunderstandings does n=

was once discussing the meaning of "Mantra Pushpam" here (see http://groups=

 me th=

 ascends and denser elements coming back from lighter elements as Kundalini=
 descends. When I pointed out weaknesses in that interpretation, he told me=
 that that was the *vision* (internal experience) he got when he meditated =
with it. However, that absolutely does not add up. What is described in Man=
tra Pushpam is not chain of X merging in Y, Y merging in Z, etc. Moreover, =
all elements are not covered. Moreover, water is common, i.e. X lies in wat=
er, water lies in X; Y lies in water, water lies in Y, and so on. That is d=
