elieve in any religion
 
Dear Aparna,

There is a city with many tall skysc=
rapers. We are on the ground (or,
perhaps underground). And our goal is to =
get onto the roof of one of
these very tall buildings, which is above the c=
louds. How do you get
to the top?

There are so many different tall buildin=
gs. Each of these is like a
religion. You may be more familiar with some of=
 them, and others might
look frightening. Inside, there are so many differe=
nt sets of
elevators (paths of sadhana). Some of the elevators will go slow=
, and
some will go fast. Some will go all the way to the top, and some will=

only go to specific floors.

Once we are inside the elevator, we might enj=
oy so many sensations,
like the acceleration and deceleration of the elevat=
or. We might like
it so much that we forget about getting to the top, and s=
imply go up
and down the elevator. The elevator may stop at so many floors.=
 Each
floor is a tempation. From the elevator, we may see many sights and
h=
ear many sounds. Again, we might forget about our goal and get off
the elev=
ator.

At the beginning, we have to be careful. We should stay on the
eleva=
tor all the way to the top. Anything else takes us away from our
goal. But,=
 at the end, we have to get off the elevator. After all, the
goal is to get=
 to the top of the building, and not to stay inside.
Perhaps we have to tak=
e some stairs and open some doors to get out
onto the roof.

Perhaps you ca=
n think of each of these tall building like a religion.
Yes, they may appea=
r to be an obstacle (after all, when you are inside
the building, and insid=
e an elevator, the sky is not at all visible).
But, the quickest and safest=
 way to get to the roof is to go inside,
and take an elevator to the top.

=
Some people may advise a more direct path, always keeping the goal in
sight=
. They may say that you should directly climb the outside of the
building. =
They may be technically correct, but this path is not for
everyone.

>From a=
 practical point of view, the answer is simple -- do sadhana and
more sadha=
na. Do it inside of your religious construct if it helps
you. Ignore the re=
ligious constructs when they become an obstacle.

There are so many mails o=
n this list. Every mail serves a purpose.
But, not all mails are applicable=
 or useful to everyone. Read and
re-read the mails that are useful, and ign=
ore the ones that aren't. At
the end of the day, you will learn much more f=
rom sadhana than you
will from the mails on this list.

sasneham,

 while,
>>=C2=A0 but he has probably lost his mental balance due to smo=

 to X in clear English, "Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me."=
 X was of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English an=

was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes).
>>

>> The man con=
tinued, "My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by=
 profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu since =
then." X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang?=
 Mr Iyengar replied, "All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is =
source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not o=
rdinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all the religious t=
roubles and other nonsense." X felt a little irritated, "Why do you have so=
 much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu fo=
r long, then how come you haven't met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it=
 possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there is =
only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, merely=
 different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not ac=
cessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The root of
>>=C2=A0 all this p=
roblem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God =
ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to compreh=
end. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman w=
ith super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will cr=
eate this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire sup=
ernatural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded by others as =
a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the pro=
blem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stres=
sing that one has understood correctly." While talking, the sadhu stopped a=
t a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the=
 chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly rele=
asing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, "You (meaning X) are a yo=

did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infa=
mous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day=
 having nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I s=

he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a young girl =
came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said t=

food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar's feet as he lay down on=
 a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he =
abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hosp=

ion to the cot. He too turned round to see what was going on. What he saw m=

t was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his early=
 twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow=
 that lightened
 up the
>>=C2=A0 whole room. He had a shaved head, four arm=
s, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked n=
ot a human being any more but a god sitting in place of what was even five =
minutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.
>>

>> X did not kno=
w what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stand up=
 and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked upto the=
 cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When he w=
oke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location with trees and sh=
rubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him insi=
de the temple precincts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it an ol=
d man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar =
did not say a word, pointed out that meditating man to him and then took X =
out of the temple. That is the man I was talking about, he said. You should=
 meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has an id=
ea what God really means. After providing directions of how to reach that d=
esolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt he was lo=

.

 helped him. Perhaps it would be useful for us to know about this too.<br>&=

hu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring s=

said, "Maharaj, please tell us some words of God". The man became angry, an=

ay. If God comes, all will run away. So please continue with your lectures
=
 as you were doing before I came in". Everyone became uncomfortably silent =
hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mout=
h, looked up at the sky and then got up and started walking off. After he w=
ent out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, "He=
 is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while,<br>>>  but h=
e has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking too much ganja". Now =
X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt attracted to that ragg=
ed man and went out to see where the guy was going. As he approached the ra=
gged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear English, "H=
ello, I was waiting for you to come and join me." X was of course taken aba=
ck, did not expect the man to speak in English and more over he had no clue=
 how the man got to know that he knew English (X was dressed in the garb of=
 a sadhu - saffron clothes).<br>>><br>>><br>>> The
 man c=
ontinued, "My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer =
by profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu sinc=
e then." X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsan=
g? Mr Iyengar replied, "All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself i=
s source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not=
 ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all the religious=
 troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little irritated, "Why do you have =
so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu =
for long, then how come you haven't met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is =
it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there i=
s only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, mere=
ly different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not =
accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The root
 of<br>>> =
; all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cann=
ot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brai=
n to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magni=
fied woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one da=
y he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even=
 acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded b=
y others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the roo=
t of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind an=
d then stressing that one has understood correctly." While talking, the sad=
hu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull fini=
shed off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes,=
 slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, "You (meaning=
 X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your
 head, don't get<br>>>=
  confused by all these show of spirituality you see in holy places. W=
hen I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness o=
f youth. I was an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I gre=
w up. But then one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roam=
ing for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact=
 with this thing." As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, w=
oman and a young girl came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr=
 Iyengar inturn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot =
so when I come to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you somethin=

hour inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The woman wa=
s bringing different fruits and sweets for their food while the young girl =
was massaging Mr Iyengar's feet as he
 lay down on a cot, enjoying the hosp=
itality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but =
has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a householder =
and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw =
that the man and the woman and the girl=C3=82  stood up and with folde=
d hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X=
 was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turn=
ed round to see what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in sh=
ock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat=
 on the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin=
 was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up the<br>&=
gt;>  whole room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus an=
d weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being an=

 of what was even five minutes back only =
a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.<br>>><br>>><br>>> X di=
d not know what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him to=
 stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked=
 upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. =
When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location with tre=
es and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took=
 him inside the temple precincts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to=
 it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr=
 Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that meditating man to him and the=
n took X out of the temple. That is the man I was talking about, he said. Y=
ou should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who =
has an idea what God really means. After providing directions of how to rea=
ch that desolate temple, Mr
 Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt=
 he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into<br>>>  un=
consciousness again.<br>>><br>>><br>>> When X woke up, he=
 was in the room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the b=

of those who don't believe in religion or God are being more honest than th=

ze these biases.<br>>><br>>> While being mired in this word of =
duality, we think that an ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weig=
ht of "paapa" that we engage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on=
 our God. No wonder that others look at all the suffering in the world and =
laugh at this concept of God. We "God believers" are
 the culprit.<br>>&=
gt;<br>>> We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipelin=
e. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both ki=
nds of fruits, we ask God to burn "paapa" and leave the "punya" intact. It =
is us "God believers" who look at our lives, ignoring all the "paapa phala"=
. We look at one or two instances of "punya phala" and declare our prayers =
to be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, an=
d laughs at us. We "God believers" are the culprit.<br>>><br>>>=
 For the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual pr=
actices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minu=
tes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time reall=
y flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ign=
ore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is=
, and laughs at us. We "God believers" are the
 culprit.<br>>><br>>=
;> The best way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the=
 "non-believers" and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to elimi=
nate our lack of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform =
ourselves, the world will be served.<br>>><br>>> If we see God =
as the limitless power that he is, he is difficult to define. It is difficu=
lt to capture him within a religion. Religion should see itself as a steppi=
ng-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on top o=
f it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to acc=
ept them without question. They ask us to place our heads on them with reve=
rence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced from going any farther.<=
