Namaste Sunrise and Dinesh and other friends,

[
>>>>I guess the acid test =
of spiritual progress is how much we do for others. If I do japa all day, w=
hile the man next to me is sick and starving, I doubt God would be impresse=
d. Japa cleans the mind. The fruit of japa surely has to be a burning desir=
e to serve humanity. And there is no dearth of suffering on this planet, an=
d no lack of opportunity to serve.<<<<<<<<<
]

Seek forgiveness of all befo=
re hand if I will be looking biased or boring for what i am going to put do=
wn in this long message.

Since 2 days I am in endless discussions (Satsang=
 as i will call it) with a like minded individual because we have holidays =
here and our families are out in India. Yesterday, After Havan we were agai=
n discussing on Spiritual Giants such as Sain Baba, Meherbaba, Vimalananda,=
 Ramakrishna and about various Sadhanas and to be in hurry to put in practi=
ce etc... etc... Our discussion turned finally to India's condition and Sar=
dar Vallabhbhai Patel. We talked about him, remembered him for almost 4 hou=
rs without a break when suddenly we saw that It was 2 am! i left his home a=
nd came to my home, feeling myself completely overewhelmed by my Sardar Pat=
el. PratH Smaraniya! I could not sleep and kept remembering him surfing for=
 him on the net and rejoicing and celebrating his personality and Karmayoga=
....Sheer Karmyoga!!!

If somebody has patience and gratitude enough to rem=
ember one of the real Sons of India, one can go through this matter of fact=
 article about him which i came across yesterday:

http://www.dadinani.com/=
capture-memories/read-contributions/major-events-pre-1950/218-my-memories-o=
f-sardar-patel-by-r-c-mody


Yesterday only I was telling my friend that I =
respect, love and admire Sardar Patel not less then even likes of Ramakrish=
na Paramhamsa, Vivekananda and such few. We discussed his Karma Yoga. livin=
g every moment of his extremely valuable life for his countrymen without ex=
pecting any reward. Unparalleled Political sacrifice by leaving opportunity=
 to become 1st Prime Minister of Modern india.  

Whenever Karma Yoga comes=
 in Mind - 2 Individual unfailingly comes to my mind - Swami Vivekananda an=
d Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Off course there are and will be few others, le=
ss famous or not at all famous but these 2 Karmayogis are the heroes who ha=
ve positively affected life of the entire Nation.

YES! Karmayoga is extrem=
ely difficult path (Real Karma Yoga).

***
However, in the same breath I wi=
sh to put some personal thoughts in which i have conviction. I have always =
instinctively believed that the most important thing is to *purify one self=
 and build the character*. One is bound to serve fellow human being in the =
best way only when he or she has purified his/herself and built personal ch=
aracter. we all know about Swami Vivekananda and his ruthless pursuit to pu=
rify himself by Sadhana in his early years. Although Sardar Patel was not t=
hat Religious in popular sense, his entire life is living example of Purifi=
cation and building a character which is ready to conclude a Gigantic, near=
 impossible task of Unifying and forging India.

when one has built up char=
acter (i.e. controlled all Shadripus and developed justness, compassion and=
 such high virtues), one would be then chosen by Mother Nature to serve man=
y many people. it does not mean though that one does not serve fellow human=
 being till one is purified enough. Both are simultaneous processes. You th=
ink about others selflessly, do good to people as much as you can, develop =
compassion to all creatures and side by side do Sadhana to purify yourself.=
 But if absolute choice is given then I would stick to Sadhana (Say Japa, H=
avana etc...) because of a firm belief that I must purify myself, built up =
the most important thing called character, come to a point wherein My ego i=
s reduced to bare minimum, come to a point where Shadripus have been annihi=
lated or completely controlled and then I know that if I have a desire left=
 for serving humanity then Mother Nature would surely use me as a tool in h=
er hand to server Humanity and that would be then real Karma Yoga! That wou=
ld be real good to all fellow human being. However, for all practical purpo=
se, I must do Sadhana and at the same time think about others well being, w=
ork for others well being as selflessly as possible!

I agree with Dinesh w=
hen he said :"People love to preach
and pontificate, and in all likelihood =
they have no *real* experience of what they are talking about and are indul=
ging in, well, intellectual <insert-the-verb-here>."

Yes, at least now, of=
f late, i have understood that it is not at all right to preach what i do n=
ot follow or do not have any personal experiences. that is why, for me now =
one thing what matters most is Sadhana, Sadhana and Saa-dhanaa. incidentall=
y, I was pushing my friend, very hard to start a serious Sadhana and not to=
 be fascinated by spiritual Books and philosophical materials. He is a nobl=
e soul devoted to Sain-baba. Finally he decided to start Gayatri Japa Sadha=
na since today Morning - on the Ground of 5 "S" indicated by Vimalananda.

=
May Jagadamba, the Adya Shakti, creates many more purified Souls who then u=
sed by her as Karma Yogis of Highest order because we all see that How much=
 badly they are required!!!

Yours Sincerely,

Utpal
