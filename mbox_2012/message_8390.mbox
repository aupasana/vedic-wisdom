quot;Well at least on regarding the food, definitely!"</div><div>Bhair=
avi, "You people have petty minds, without any gains you don't lis=
ten to anything, you don't interact freely with others".</div>
<di=
v><br></div><div>He asked," Are you a Tantrik?" She replied, &quo=
t;Yes. What is your bhava?"</div><div>P, "I do not have fixed pat=
h, but I am very curious about Tantra and Shakti Sadhana. Can you ask you s=
ome questions about Tantra? Can a person attain God through the path of Tan=
tra?"<br>
</div><div><br></div><div>She sat down crosslegged in padmas=
ana and replied, " The word God means different things to different pe=
ople. Then attaining God has even more different and complex meanings to ev=
eryone based on their own ideas. This is not like attaining some property o=
r money. It can be attained by various path, and then again it can attained=
 by no-path at all. And the most complex thing in all this is what you refe=
r to as God is not
 something that is to be possessed at all! Are you satis=
fied with the answer?"</div><div><br></div><div>P: "What is the a=
im of Tantrik sadhanas? What is the tangible benefit? Those who are Tantrik=
s or Siddha Kaulacharis, what do they gain?"</div>
<div><br></div><div=
>Bhairavi, "Whoever does sadhana with whatever intention, they will ac=
hieve that. But real Tantra-sadhana, which is vira-chara, is about becoming=
 free from chains (pashas). Only when the chains have been broken that divi=
ne Shakti is awakened in the body. Now if someone then uses this Divine Sha=
kti for personal gains, then they head towards great calamity. Those who us=
e it for the good of humanity, they become really divine".</div>
<div>=
<br></div><div>Till now she was speaking calmly. Now P asked, "But the=
 answer that you gave seems like a riddle to me. Are you trying to imply th=
at man cannot attain God through Tantra?"</div><div><br></div>
<div>Bh=
airavi:"If you had been intelligent, you would not
 have asked this qu=
estion. Forget about attaining God for the moment, first learn to acquire s=
hakti. Have you done that? Start immediately and by Bhagawati's grace y=
ou will accomplish. This I can guarantee.=A0 First become a Shaktiman, unde=
rstand what is Shakti and how much Shakti you are capable of holding in you=
r body and mind. Understood? Don't waste your time in useless debates. =
Did you understand what I am saying?"</div>
<div><br></div><div>The Bh=
airavi looked angry, the color of her face has suddenly changed and her eye=
s become still and unblinking. P felt scared. He kept quite. She continued:=
" All these idiots having read a few books here and there have only le=
arnt useless debates and time-wasting. Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Sh=
aktihin (sans Shakti), medhahin (sans intellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you=
 guys get kicked from your bosses in office, and the come home and show off=
 your impotency on your wives and mothers. And you want to debate
 on Shakt=
i sadhana! This is ridiculous!"</div><div><br></div><div>P got unnerve=
d and was certain that she is a mad woman. The moment this thought came in =
his mind, she stood up at a lightning pace and screamed back, " Oh you=
 think I am mad? You don't know who I am. I can destroy you completely,=
 or I can make you into a real Shaktiman. Do you want to see?"</div>
<=
div><br></div><div>His mind became stunned into silence. He did not know wh=
at to say. In fear, he looked down at his own feet unable to make any conve=
rsation and started chanting the name of Krishna to save him. He wondered i=
f he should now get up and run away from that place. Immediate she came ove=
r to where he was sitting and held his shoulders, "Where will you run?=
 Do you think you have the ability to escape from me, without my willing it=
? I consider people like you nothing more than insects. You've left you=
r wife and son and gone out roaming to peform Dharma! You don't even kn=
ow what Dharma
 means. An idiot of the first order. People like you are she=
ep, not men. Escapists and cowards. Throw away all your bookish adwaitha in=
to the Ganges. It's nonsense. Either do you know what is bhoga, nor do =
you know what is yoga, running away from life and believing that by escapin=
g one attains to renunciation. No passion for life, no passion for God. Dea=
d decayed individuals. A sheep whose only contribution to life is to reprod=
uce some more sheep and then run away from them. Idiot!"</div>
<div><b=
r></div><div>In fear and shame the P felt like he would faint any moment. F=
or the first time in his wanderings he felt so depressed about himself that=
 he did not know what to say. Like in a trance he felt his <br></div>
<div>=
vision was becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fall down on the floor=
, when the Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his shoulders and said, &q=
uot;There is no renunciation or detachment from life in your heart and mind=
. How dare you argue and
 dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha awaits you and you=
 think you can escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Are you free fr=
om desires of life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through you". He =
could not lift his eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt ashamed of h=
imself and in a feeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her feet and st=
arted crying, "Ma please save me.=A0 You are right. I am an idiot, I a=
m a coward, I am an escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and child=
ren at home. I am weak of mind and heart." His voice became choked wit=
h tears.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Hearing this the Bhairavi became silent.=
 She held his chin with her right-hand and lifted up his face to the light.=
 Her eyes had changed color and there was a tremendous compassion on her fa=
ce. "What do you think I am? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from =
hell to torment you, a raving mad woman?"<br>
</div><div><br></div><di=
v>And P replied, "But I have not said
 anything to you like that, have=
 I?". Hearing this she became furious with anger, "Will you peopl=
e never become real men? You think something in your heart and you lie thro=
ugh your teeth when asked. Don't you have any tej, shakti anything at a=
ll? Lying to escape situations? Is this the character of real purush? Soft =
like mud who can be molded into any obnoxious character when challenged by =
situations? And you think you can learn vira-bhava of Bhairava? Fool! What =
do you do in life?"</div>
<div><br></div><div>P replied he was a paint=
er before he left home. Hearing this her eyes widened in a childlike excite=
ment. She lost her anger completely and asked," Can you draw me a pict=
ure? I have been searching for a good artist? Can you draw a picture of Chi=
nnamasta? I've not found anyone who can draw her properly".</div>
=
<div><br></div><div>P, "Printed pictures of Chinnamasta are easily ava=
ilable in the market for a very little price". Hearing this she starte=
d
 roaring with laughter, "Printed in the markets you say? Hah! Chinna=
masta? <br></div><div>Have you gone mad? <again laughter>."</div=
><div><br></div><div>P, "I find her image very violent and terrifying&=
quot;.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Then the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud=
 that it sounded like a humkar, "Fool! For people like you who are wor=
st than women, it is but natural that Chinnamasta will look scary and terri=
fying. People who are scared at the first sight of blood and death will not=
 appreciate her beauty! Those who remain trapped in conditioned thinking of=
 pap vs punya, sarga vs naraka, good vs bad, and other dualities cannot und=
erstand the madness of Chinnamasta. You will only be able to draw a white S=
araswati with her beena and live trying to deny the other aspects and reali=
ties of life, the death and the decay and never see the grand play of the U=
niverse. For you and your ilk, a woman is an object of subconscious revulsi=
on, you run scared
 when you see the first woman approaching, you run away =
from your own wife, how on earth can you handle the terrible beauty of Chin=
namasta?"</div><div><br></div><div>Then she pushed him with her hand. =
He fell on the floor. She continued, "Go drown yourself in the Ganges =
and before doing so pray to Jagadamba Durga that She may make you fit to ho=
ld shakti in your next life. Or at least beg Her, implore Her, that She may=
 grant you intelligence to understand what is Shakti-tattwa."</div>
<d=
iv><br></div><div>Hearing these words, P was so depressed that his mind plu=
nged into chaos and darkness. Like in a state of debilitating trance, he go=
t up from the floor and sat down. The Bhairavi was not there in the room. H=
e looked all around him. Then he saw her on the road outside, walking towar=
ds the ganges. He cried out to her, "Don't leave me here, I must k=
now who you are. I am confused about life and everything else". As soo=
n as he uttered these words, the room
 started reverberating with a attahas=
a, though there was not a soul present there apart from him. A laughter so =
loud that he left his ear drums will split. He rushed out into the rain to =
follow the moving figure of the Bhairavi. The faster he ran, the more did t=
he distance keep increasing between him and the Bhairavi. Then he could see=
 clearly, the Bhairavi entering into the Ganges water, and kept moving deep=
er until she was drowned completely in the water. The author sat near the b=
anks, shouting out to her, asking her to come out and help him. But there w=
as no response. Just the regular lapping sound of waves hitting the shore a=
nd a very dark night. <br>
</div><div><br></div><div>He sat there till sunr=
ise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. Next morning he went and asked a=
round the village, but no one had seen the Bhairavi and neither was there a=
ny shop near the banks which sold food. Because of the heavy rains, everyth=
ing was shut down last night
 with not a soul in the open.</div><div><br></=
div><div><br></div><div>Years later, P went back home to his wife and son a=
nd lead a full and complete family life. I have merely narrated the inciden=
t as it is.<br></div><div>

<div><span>Divine Mother care=

and ludo with them. Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji is one of Dash MahaVidya and =
Her Swroop is very difficult to look at for me. Her Appearence Day Tithi ha=
s just gone by few weeks ago.</span></div>

<div><span></span>=A0</div>
<di=
v><span>Many years ago when I was living in Brajbhoomi, a sadhu came one la=
te evening to my ashram. After some time he took me to a quite corner and t=
old me certain thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had a glow on his fa=
ce and had certain powers about him I believed him. Later on he also gave m=
e a Mantra of=A0Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu left in the morn=
ing and I never saw him again. Somehow the things he told me did not happen=
 and this tithi became very upsetting for me.</span></div>

<div><span></sp=

<div><span>Some years back here in London I was coming home in=
 the afternoon. I was in a crowded bus and holding on to railings.Suddenly =
I rememberd that it was Tithi of Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. I started to re=
cite Her mantra\name and try to meditate on Her in that crowded bus. I even=
 smiled myself on the strangeness of that situation. After few more minutes=
 I reached home and opened my front door and went inside. After going throu=
gh my Puja room and telling my mother that I was back, I flopped on sofa in=
 front room which is very near to front gate. Then I heard some noises but =
I did not get up and slept for nearly one hour. After I got up I got a srro=
ng feeling to open my front door although nobody had knocked. The whole are=
a in front of my house was covered in Police lines and tapes. I could not b=
elieve it. </span></div>

<div><span></span>=A0</div>
<div><span>I asked a =
policeman who was near my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were shootin=
g at each other and then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that day =
I was clearly saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner sky =
several minutes before the incident and I started Her prayers although ther=
e was no reasons for me to do so. Then I slept whole time without knowing a=
 single thing as load of armed policemen were there after those gunman.and =
whole noises and drama.</span></div>

The ways of god are very mysterious and we humans especially in this yug ha=

<div><br><sp=
an></span></div>
<div><span>As I write this I show no hatred towards you or=
 those people who talk in similar fashion. It is their ignorance and the so=

nitely pray for your inner growth. <br>
</span></div>
<div><span><br></span=

<div><span>Nobody ji has spoken thousand words of wisdom hats off t=

ing with no attention. He yelled at me and I learnt driving in one day. Som=
e students don't listen when explained gently, some students listen onl=

<div><span>Another thing I alway=

y any other devotees. We all know Narsimha ji but we don't know which o=
