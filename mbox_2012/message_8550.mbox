I enjoyed reading this. Not least because as a University student aged 23 I=
 spent 2-3 years in turmoil as I foolishly thought external Sanyas was the =
only way to Realisation. Swami Vivekananda's quotation " The difference bet=
ween a Sanyasi and a householder is like that between Mount Meru and a must=
ard seed" rang in my head for ages and destroyed my peace for a long time (=
and destroyed a relationship too!). 

I was desperate not to be a lowly 'mu=
stard seed'. Anyway, I have grown up a little since, and realised it is the=
 mind not the clothes that need to be 'dyed ochre' as it were. It is no eas=
y task to immerse the mind in God as a 'householder' (the path I have chose=
n) but perhaps not that much easier sitting in an Ashram or distant cave ei=
ther. So might as well stay put in the world and be useful, and think of Go=
d too. That's my path anyway for now. I'm sure each one of us is where we n=
eed to be at any point in time...be it 'householder' or 'sanyasi'. 

Om Nam=
o Narayanaya.
