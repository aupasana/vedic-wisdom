 For everything that one giant has said, there is always another one who ha=
s said exactly the opposite. And a third and forth one who came up with a d=
ifferent view-point, differing with all the previous ones. And each of thes=
e giants have spoken with the utmost conviction of their own realizations o=

 in an objective analysis of the philosophy. Just like the personality and =

agat (beyond this astral plane). If a person is able to awaken his/her Kund=

 the sanest advices, ever. In the milieu of spirituality, too many people g=
et caught up in the less important - aka, visions, 'experiences', tough-pen=
ances, complex rituals, offbeat sadhanas etc etc, while forgetting the goal=
 of real spirituality, that is transformation of mind/emotions/body resulti=
ng in greater surrender to the Divine, greater equanimity to life situation=
s, an abiding calm and peace, genuine humility, lessening of lower emotions=
 like lust, anger, jealously, hatred, cravings, furious attachments, such t=
hat eventually every action of the individual is like a consecration (sacri=
fice, yagjya) to the Divine. A life so transformed and so away from our ave=
rage superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment on its own. God i=

 a transformation process.

 the fundamentals. THEN these can be useful. Otherwise one ends up running =
in circles and going nowhere. An experience-chaser is not necessary a spiri=
tual entity. I had to learn this basic truth the hard-way.
