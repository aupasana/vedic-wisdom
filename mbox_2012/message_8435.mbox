Respected Punditji (Mr Rao)

Pranaam! just a while ago when I accidentally =
hit at your 'About Me'n asa I was thru with it I felt a profound sense of r=
everence towards you n your family. Anybody will be in awe of you looking a=
t yr  accomplishments. Rare n unachievable. Yr Poem 'Blissful Ignorance'is =
very thought provoking - the last verse applies to people like me. 

You al=
l seem highly blessed by The Almighty. He has also created people like us w=
ho are not so blessed and right now are going through a real rough patch in=
 our life.

My husband who is also an IIT-IAN Delhi(B. Tech civil) was deal=
t a real hard blow by fate in 2009 when he lost a very well paid job n was =
laid off for almost a  yr. Actually since then we are only on a terrible fi=
nancial n emotional downslide. He is 59yrs old n still not in a position to=
 build a house. He supported his father all his life n still Father sold hi=
s own house and did not choose to give him, may be because Bala married me.=
 Our stories of monetary losses are too many. Got terribly cheated in a lan=
d deal etc. etc...................

Since you seem so able n a perfect Astr=
ologer I hope you will provide us with some guidance whether we will be abl=
e to sail thru' life without troubling our kith n kin and w/o  losing our s=
elf esteem.

Our problems are compounded by my failing health due to Osteoa=
rthiritis. We live in Bahrain. Owing to his frequent changing of jobs we ar=
e made to pack unpack many times and in the process have lost a lot of mone=
y n mental peace. I am a housewife. Also we are chidless. Ours is an inter-=
caste marriage. My husband's name is Bala. He is a Brahmin from Palaghat(Iy=
er), whereas I am from Delhi (Both my parents expired within last one n a h=
alf yrs.)after that family n relations have all fallen apart. Whenever we g=
o to India we have to now stay in some lodge or hotel. All this is only inc=
reasing our tensions, with not sufficient money to get by. He is not able t=
o get a well-paid job without which we shudder to think what might happen t=
o us in future n at older age, who will take care of us, things like that. =
We would consider ourselves very fortunate if we could get yr expert advice=
. 

I have also studied Astrology on my own sitting at home. But when compa=
red to you I am nothing. Bala does have faith in my analysis of his chart b=
ut lately I am not able to see a few things clearly for him. So I thought o=
f finding some help n I felt I found one of the best, all by God's Grace! W=
e hope thru you we will get HIS help which we need very badly and soon.
   =

I am providing his n my birth details :

BALA 17 Oct 1953 - Time-7.05 am,-=
 Place- Manama, Bahrain. 

WIFE 8 JUNE 1958 -  Time-10.00 pm - Jodhpur Raja=
sthan India


Please let us know if there is any fees to be paid and how.

=

Please accept our obeisance unto your feet. And may The Almighty Lord cont=
inue to shower His blessings upon yr very dedicated family.


Best Regards
=

Balas
