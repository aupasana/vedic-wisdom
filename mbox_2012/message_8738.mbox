Namaste,

I would add here some more thoughts on speed.

In spiritual field=
, "Speed" also mean (interchangeable with) the Path one takes to reach the =
goal. There are external Rituals and/or direct mental processes (such as Ha=
van, continuous Vichara for instance) which has capacity to take one relati=
vely quickly to goal (fast Burning of Karmas and hence more and more detach=
ed actions, reduction of Ego sense of me & Mine and all such fundamentals) =
as compared to some other Spiritual Sadhanas. For instance, one can interna=
lly feel that, Chandi Havan is ferociously generating sense of detachment i=
n quicker time than in comparison to Pranaayam or such Yogic processes.

It=
 is a matter of judgment purely based on personal experience that one can r=
ealize. Probably very difficult to explain. One will know "speed" in the ab=
ove sense when one has practice different modes and realize as to which the=
 more suitable process is for one.

However, the main point remains non-deb=
atable and that is the focus on right direction (fundamentals as we say) al=
ways.

Aurobindo's warning of dangerous intermediate zone must always be re=
membered by all Seekers whatever may be their level of progress.

Best Rega=
rds,

Utpal

For any genuine spiritual seeker, this is one of the sanest advices, ever. =
In the milieu of spirituality, too many people get caught up in the less im=
portant - aka, visions, 'experiences', tough-penances, complex rituals, off=
beat sadhanas etc etc, while forgetting the goal of real spirituality, that=
 is transformation of mind/emotions/body resulting in greater surrender to =
the Divine, greater equanimity to life situations, an abiding calm and peac=
e, genuine humility, lessening of lower emotions like lust, anger, jealousl=
y, hatred, cravings, furious attachments, such that eventually every action=
 of the individual is like a consecration (sacrifice, yagjya) to the Divine=
. A life so transformed and so away from our average superficial existence,=
 that it becomes a fulfillment on its own. God is not the finish line of a =
bicycle race. It is the progressive unfolding of a transformation process. =

 provided one does not lose sight of the fundamentals. THEN these can be us=
eful. Otherwise one ends up running in circles and going nowhere. An experi=
ence-chaser is not necessary a spiritual entity. I had to learn this basic =
truth the hard-way.
