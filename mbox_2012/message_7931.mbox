Shri Narasimhaji and other respected members,

Namaste!

Lord Brahma is one=
 of the Trinity and represents the "Creator" aspect in all consciousness, h=
owever, there is lack of specific information on Puja/sadhana done for him.=


While we do provide offerings to Brahma as we do to Vishnu and to Rudra i=
n homams and other rituals, why don't we perform Puja to Lord Brahma, which=
 however, we perform to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva/Rudra? Why isn't there a=
ny written material about Pujas to Lord Brahma? 

Thanks and best regards,
=
Manish
