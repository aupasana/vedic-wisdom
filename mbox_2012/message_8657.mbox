Mon Sep 3, 2012 4:24 am (PDT) . Posted by:      "vedic_pathak" ve=
dic_pathak                         Just to add further, I never tried combi=
ned practices of Havan and Sudarshan Kriya. Any ways, It is matter of findi=
ng out by one's own experiences (and that is actually the only way)rather t=
han relying on experiences of others. This is also opinion of Mihir and Nar=
asimha Garu. unless ofcourse one has a spiritual Guru and full faith in Gur=
u to just blindly perform the Sadhana commanded by Guru. for such person it=
 is fine not to roam around.

Medium used in Sudarshan Kriya is Air (on gro=
ss level atleast) while that in Homam/Havan is Fire and it is only logical =
to think that there must lie some differences in terms of speed/quality/eff=
ects in their respective evolutionary curves and as far as I am concerned, =
I have probably had some knwoeldge of differences using Air and Fire. I can=
 see that Mihir's experience of SK is somewhat similar to mine. It'll be in=
teresting to note here that I did perform a couple of havans with the inspi=
ration of AOL and that was Mahamritunjaya Havan, back in 2006 (before i sta=
rted Havan regularly in 2008 with the divine inspiration of Narasimha).

             Just to add fur=
ther, I never tried combined practices of Havan and Sudarshan Kriya. Any wa=
ys, It is matter of finding out by one's own experiences (and that is actua=
lly the only way)rather than relying on experiences of others. This is also=
 opinion of Mihir and Narasimha Garu. unless ofcourse one has a spiritual G=
uru and full faith in Guru to just blindly perform the Sadhana commanded by=
 Guru. for such person it is fine not to roam around.<br>
<br>
Medium used =
in Sudarshan Kriya is Air (on gross level atleast) while that in Homam/Hava=
n is Fire and it is only logical to think that there must lie some differen=
ces in terms of speed/quality/<wbr>effects in their respective evolutionary=
 curves and as far as I am concerned, I have probably had some knwoeldge of=
 differences using Air and Fire. I can see that Mihir's experience of SK is=
 somewhat similar to mine. It'll be interesting to note here that I did per=
form a couple of havans with the inspiration of AOL and that was Mahamritun=
jaya Havan, back in 2006 (before i started Havan regularly in 2008 with the=
 divine inspiration of Narasimha).<br>
