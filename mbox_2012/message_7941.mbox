Well said :-)

The best is to continue sadhana and most of these trivial do=
ubts vanish slowly; at a stage it is possible one realizes that the milk of=
fered to homam by not giving it to a kid will be repaid by the deity immedi=
ately in some form to the kid who is crying for it. After all the deities a=
re *bigger* parents that any of us are.

Btw, one who has an internet conne=
ction has only one glass of milk to choose between a deity and a kid, duh !=
 :-)
