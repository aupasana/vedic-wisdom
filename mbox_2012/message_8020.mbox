Namaste - Initially I took it more as educational request, but I see that y=
ou mention "kindly suggest" ! That sounds more like you want to try this !
=

Although it was for Sh Narasimha, I will give my cents as this was posted =
to the group.

Manish ji said once, you should see mother at home first bef=
ore trying to see her in SmashAn. 

The schools of thought I follow does no=
t let women do the last rites.

Lastly, I am not sure what your intent is; =
but let me take it to one extreme and caution based on my experience in oth=
er school I am part of. The individuals who stuck to basics, not trying vip=
areeta (extreme) rituals made better progress than the enthusiastic ones wh=
ose goal was to experience gopi bhAva, etc sooner. I remember your mails wh=
ere you mentioned worshipping Ugra devata did not work for you at one point=
 of time, so this mail surprised me ! 
I am taking liberty in adding more t=
han normally I do. Hope you take it rightly.

regards
rAma
