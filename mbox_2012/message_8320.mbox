Hi,

I am looking for some motivation to keep going with the homam practice=
. I did a bit last year, then stopped and started again last week. I know t=
he best motivator is one's own personal experience by doing the practice an=
d I intend to do homams regularly- well, at least once in two weeks at pres=
ent (given my work schedule as a trainee doctor). 

However, in the meantim=
e, it would help to hear about others' positive experiences with their prac=
tice.

Do people feel that their homam practice brings more peace, happines=
s in their lives? 

I live in the UK and there is nobody in the city where =
I live to talk to about homams so it is pretty lonely, and quite hard to ge=
t motivated. My family are supportive of me in many ways, but not really in=
terested when it comes to homams/japa etc...they are quite amused/bemused b=
y it all and tolerate it politely. 

Any ladies/people living in the UK who=
 are interested in starting a homam-at-home group to motivate/support each =
other? (There must be at least one other woman in the UK who's in this grou=
p and interested in homams...please email me!) I'm delighted that women are=
 allowed to do homams....it would be great to have a group to support each =
other (I'm sure this is a long shot, but it's worth asking). 

Regards,

Ap=
