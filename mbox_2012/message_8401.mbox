      Namaste,
Speaking of Goddess Chinnamasta, I recall a true inciden=
t. Let me narrate the same here.

On his way to Gangotri, an individual nam=
ed "P" reached a small, less-populated village. It was evening and a slight=
 drizzle poured on the backdrop of a orange colored setting sun. He was won=
dering where to spend the night, when he suddenly found a Bhairavi standing=
 infront of him. He was surprised. Shakti sadhana is not that popular in th=
ese parts of India, neither are Tantriks and Bhairavis. She wore a red sari=
, had a jata on her head and a trishul in one hand and small cloth tied int=
o a knot in her other hand. She looked about 32-34 years of age and was str=
ikingly beautiful looking.

Before he could
 open his mouth, she started sp=
eaking and speaking. First she spoke in Hindi, then Punjabi and then Marath=
i. Because of his travels across India, the author was familiar with the so=
und of different Indian languages but could not understand them. Then she s=
poke in Bengali which was the P's mother-tongue. "Are you going to Gangotri=
? Have you found a place to stay for the night?". P was not too pleased see=
ing her. He loved his own solitary wanderings and was not keen on company. =
So to avoid her, he said I have found a place to stay for the night but it =
is extremely dirty, littered with droppings of wild animals and infested wi=
th snakes and scorpions. She insisted that she will be able to manage and i=
t was afterall only a matter of one night to avoid the rains. Once the stay=
ing place was reached, she cleaned the place up with a fallen branch from a=
 tree, laid out her belongings on one side and lit a fire with some twigs. =
Then she asked him if had any food. P
 replied he did not, plus all the sho=
ps in the area were closed due to the inclement weather. She got up and sai=
d she has to take a bath in the Ganges nearby and will come back soon. Afte=
r about half and hour she returned back with a something tied in a cloth. S=
he opened the cloth and took out 2 rotis and some bhaji and gave it to the =
author to eat. The author was mildly surprised and on inquiry was told that=
 near the bank of Ganges she had found one small eatery and she got the foo=
d from there. She herself did not eat anything but gave the food to the him=
, saying she was not hungry. P felt grateful for the food and confessed tha=
t he would have gone hungry tonight, had it not been for her, because he di=
d not have money to buy food. 

She asked with surprise, "You have come so =
far with any money? Where is your home? ETC ETC." On hearing his answers, s=
he asked, "So do you believe that your meeting me is due to the will of
 Ja=
gadamba?". He replied, "Well at least on regarding the food, definitely!"Bh=
airavi, "You people have petty minds, without any gains you don't listen to=
 anything, you don't interact freely with others".
He asked," Are you a Tan=
trik?" She replied, "Yes. What is your bhava?"P, "I do not have fixed path,=
 but I am very curious about Tantra and Shakti Sadhana. Can you ask you som=
e questions about Tantra? Can a person attain God through the path of Tantr=
a?"

She sat down crosslegged in padmasana and replied, " The word God mean=
s different things to different people. Then attaining God has even more di=
fferent and complex meanings to everyone based on their own ideas. This is =
not like attaining some property or money. It can be attained by various pa=
th, and then again it can attained by no-path at all. And the most complex =
thing in all this is what you refer to as God is not
 something that is to =
be possessed at all! Are you satisfied with the answer?"
P: "What is the ai=
m of Tantrik sadhanas? What is the tangible benefit? Those who are Tantriks=
 or Siddha Kaulacharis, what do they gain?"
Bhairavi, "Whoever does sadhana=
 with whatever intention, they will achieve that. But real Tantra-sadhana, =
which is vira-chara, is about becoming free from chains (pashas). Only when=
 the chains have been broken that divine Shakti is awakened in the body. No=
w if someone then uses this Divine Shakti for personal gains, then they hea=
d towards great calamity. Those who use it for the good of humanity, they b=
ecome really divine".
Till now she was speaking calmly. Now P asked, "But t=
he answer that you gave seems like a riddle to me. Are you trying to imply =
that man cannot attain God through Tantra?"
Bhairavi:"If you had been intel=
ligent, you would not
 have asked this question. Forget about attaining God=
 for the moment, first learn to acquire shakti. Have you done that? Start i=
mmediately and by Bhagawati's grace you will accomplish. This I can guarant=
ee.=C2=A0 First become a Shaktiman, understand what is Shakti and how much =
Shakti you are capable of holding in your body and mind. Understood? Don't =
waste your time in useless debates. Did you understand what I am saying?"
T=
he Bhairavi looked angry, the color of her face has suddenly changed and he=
r eyes become still and unblinking. P felt scared. He kept quite. She conti=
nued:" All these idiots having read a few books here and there have only le=
arnt useless debates and time-wasting. Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Sh=
aktihin (sans Shakti), medhahin (sans intellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you=
 guys get kicked from your bosses in office, and the come home and show off=
 your impotency on your wives and mothers. And you want to debate
 on Shakt=
i sadhana! This is ridiculous!"
P got unnerved and was certain that she is =
a mad woman. The moment this thought came in his mind, she stood up at a li=
ghtning pace and screamed back, " Oh you think I am mad? You don't know who=
 I am. I can destroy you completely, or I can make you into a real Shaktima=
n. Do you want to see?"
His mind became stunned into silence. He did not kn=
ow what to say. In fear, he looked down at his own feet unable to make any =
conversation and started chanting the name of Krishna to save him. He wonde=
red if he should now get up and run away from that place. Immediate she cam=
e over to where he was sitting and held his shoulders, "Where will you run?=
 Do you think you have the ability to escape from me, without my willing it=
? I consider people like you nothing more than insects. You've left your wi=
fe and son and gone out roaming to peform Dharma! You don't even know what =
Dharma
 means. An idiot of the first order. People like you are sheep, not =
men. Escapists and cowards. Throw away all your bookish adwaitha into the G=
anges. It's nonsense. Either do you know what is bhoga, nor do you know wha=
t is yoga, running away from life and believing that by escaping one attain=
s to renunciation. No passion for life, no passion for God. Dead decayed in=
dividuals. A sheep whose only contribution to life is to reproduce some mor=
e sheep and then run away from them. Idiot!"
In fear and shame the P felt l=
ike he would faint any moment. For the first time in his wanderings he felt=
 so depressed about himself that he did not know what to say. Like in a tra=
nce he felt his 
vision was becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fall =
down on the floor, when the Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his shoul=
ders and said, "There is no renunciation or detachment from life in your he=
art and mind. How dare you argue and
 dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha awaits=
 you and you think you can escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Are=
 you free from desires of life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through yo=
u". He could not lift his eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt asham=
ed of himself and in a feeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her feet=
 and started crying, "Ma please save me.=C2=A0 You are right. I am an idiot=
, I am a coward, I am an escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and =
children at home. I am weak of mind and heart." His voice became choked wit=
h tears.
Hearing this the Bhairavi became silent. She held his chin with he=
r right-hand and lifted up his face to the light. Her eyes had changed colo=
r and there was a tremendous compassion on her face. "What do you think I a=
m? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from hell to torment you, a raving m=
ad woman?"

And P replied, "But I have not said
 anything to you like that,=
 have I?". Hearing this she became furious with anger, "Will you people nev=
er become real men? You think something in your heart and you lie through y=
our teeth when asked. Don't you have any tej, shakti anything at all? Lying=
 to escape situations? Is this the character of real purush? Soft like mud =
who can be molded into any obnoxious character when challenged by situation=
s? And you think you can learn vira-bhava of Bhairava? Fool! What do you do=
 in life?"
P replied he was a painter before he left home. Hearing this her=
 eyes widened in a childlike excitement. She lost her anger completely and =
asked," Can you draw me a picture? I have been searching for a good artist?=
 Can you draw a picture of Chinnamasta? I've not found anyone who can draw =
her properly".
P, "Printed pictures of Chinnamasta are easily available in =
the market for a very little price". Hearing this she started
 roaring with=
 laughter, "Printed in the markets you say? Hah! Chinnamasta? 
Have you gon=
e mad? <again laughter>."
P, "I find her image very violent and terrifying"=
.
Then the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud that it sounded like a humkar,=
 "Fool! For people like you who are worst than women, it is but natural tha=
t Chinnamasta will look scary and terrifying. People who are scared at the =
first sight of blood and death will not appreciate her beauty! Those who re=
main trapped in conditioned thinking of pap vs punya, sarga vs naraka, good=
 vs bad, and other dualities cannot understand the madness of Chinnamasta. =
You will only be able to draw a white Saraswati with her beena and live try=
ing to deny the other aspects and realities of life, the death and the deca=
y and never see the grand play of the Universe. For you and your ilk, a wom=
an is an object of subconscious revulsion, you run scared
 when you see the=
 first woman approaching, you run away from your own wife, how on earth can=
 you handle the terrible beauty of Chinnamasta?"
Then she pushed him with h=
er hand. He fell on the floor. She continued, "Go drown yourself in the Gan=
ges and before doing so pray to Jagadamba Durga that She may make you fit t=
o hold shakti in your next life. Or at least beg Her, implore Her, that She=
 may grant you intelligence to understand what is Shakti-tattwa."
Hearing t=
hese words, P was so depressed that his mind plunged into chaos and darknes=
s. Like in a state of debilitating trance, he got up from the floor and sat=
 down. The Bhairavi was not there in the room. He looked all around him. Th=
en he saw her on the road outside, walking towards the ganges. He cried out=
 to her, "Don't leave me here, I must know who you are. I am confused about=
 life and everything else". As soon as he uttered these words, the room
 st=
arted reverberating with a attahasa, though there was not a soul present th=
ere apart from him. A laughter so loud that he left his ear drums will spli=
t. He rushed out into the rain to follow the moving figure of the Bhairavi.=
 The faster he ran, the more did the distance keep increasing between him a=
nd the Bhairavi. Then he could see clearly, the Bhairavi entering into the =
Ganges water, and kept moving deeper until she was drowned completely in th=
e water. The author sat near the banks, shouting out to her, asking her to =
come out and help him. But there was no response. Just the regular lapping =
sound of waves hitting the shore and a very dark night. 

He sat there till=
 sunrise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. Next morning he went and as=
ked around the village, but no one had seen the Bhairavi and neither was th=
ere any shop near the banks which sold food. Because of the heavy rains, ev=
erything was shut down last night
 with not a soul in the open.

Years late=
r, P went back home to his wife and son and lead a full and complete family=
 life. I have merely narrated the incident as it is.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 This letter is to cheer you up and it is=C2=A0a strange =
but true personal experience.
Divine Mother cares and protects her children=
 all the time and also plays snakes and ladders and ludo with them. Bhagvat=
i Sri Chinnmastaji is one of Dash MahaVidya and Her Swroop is very difficul=
t to look at for me. Her Appearence Day Tithi has just gone by few weeks ag=
o.
=C2=A0
Many years ago when I was living in Brajbhoomi, a sadhu came one =
late evening to my ashram. After some time he took me to a quite corner and=
 told me certain thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had a glow on his =
face and had certain powers about him I believed him. Later on he also gave=
 me a Mantra of=C2=A0Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu left in the=
 morning and I never saw him again. Somehow the things he told me did not h=
appen and this tithi became very upsetting for me.
=C2=A0
Some years back h=
ere in London I was coming home in the afternoon. I was in a crowded bus an=
d holding on to railings.Suddenly I rememberd that it was Tithi of Bhagvati=
 Sri Chinnmastaji. I started to recite Her mantra\name and try to meditate =
on Her in that crowded bus. I even smiled myself on the strangeness of that=
 situation. After few more minutes I reached home and opened my front door =
and went inside. After going through my Puja room and telling my mother tha=
t I was back, I flopped on sofa in front room which is very near to front g=
ate. Then I heard some noises but I did not get up and slept for nearly one=
 hour. After I got up I got a srrong feeling to open my front door although=
 nobody had knocked. The whole area in front of my house was covered in Pol=
ice lines and tapes. I could not believe it. 
=C2=A0
I asked a policeman wh=
o was near my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were shooting at each ot=
her and then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that day I was clearl=
y saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner sky several minu=
tes before the incident and I started Her prayers although there was no rea=
sons for me to do so. Then I slept whole time without knowing a single thin=
g as load of armed policemen were there after those gunman.and whole noises=
 and drama.
What else is this but Personal Grace of Bhagvati Sri=C2=A0Chinn=

Namaste 



Aparna ji, a few of us whom you consider a=
re blessed with the desire to pray her may definitely feel bad to read your=
 mail. The ways of god are very mysterious and we humans especially in this=
 yug have no right to ask her ruling. Calling god "damn" hurts especially f=
or those who pray her like parents. If you don't like god please keep your =
feelings towards yourself as this forum is not meant for those who hate god=
. The=C2=A0 mail that nobody ji has written is for those who already pray h=
im not for newcomers who have to yet develop love/affection/trust for god..=
.=C2=A0=C2=A0


As I write this I show no hatred towards you or those peopl=
e who talk in similar fashion. It is their ignorance and the soul transform=
ation doesn't happen easily. Hence I will definitely pray for your inner gr=
owth. 



Nobody ji has spoken thousand words of wisdom hats off to his tho=
ughts.=C2=A0 When I went to learn car driving the teacher saw me driving wi=
th no attention. He yelled at me and I learnt driving in one day. Some stud=
ents don't listen when explained gently, some students listen only when the=
 teacher yells so no offences should be taken by anyone.=C2=A0 



Another =
thing I always noticed is that for some reason most of them in this forum t=
alk with great respect to Narsimha ji and don't even consider taking advice=
s given by any other devotees. We all know Narsimha ji but we don't know wh=
ich other high raised souls we are talking to. Please talk with respect and=
 consideration towards other devotees also otherwise our prayers are a comp=
lete waste....

stay for the night?". P was not too pleased seeing her. He loved his own so=
litary wanderings and was not keen on company. So to avoid her, he said I h=
ave found a place to stay for the night but it is extremely dirty, littered=
 with droppings of wild animals and infested with snakes and scorpions. She=
 insisted that she will be able to manage and it was afterall only a matter=
 of one night to avoid the rains. Once the staying place was reached, she c=
leaned the place up with a fallen branch from a tree, laid out her belongin=
gs on one side and lit a fire with some twigs. Then she asked him if had an=
y food. P
 replied he did not, plus all the shops in the area were closed d=
ue to the inclement weather. She got up and said she has to take a bath in =
the Ganges nearby and will come back soon. After about half and hour she re=
turned back with a something tied in a cloth. She opened the cloth and took=
 out 2 rotis and some bhaji and gave it to the author to eat. The author wa=
s mildly surprised and on inquiry was told that near the bank of Ganges she=
 had found one small eatery and she got the food from there. She herself di=
d not eat anything but gave the food to the him, saying she was not hungry.=
 P felt grateful for the food and confessed that he would have gone hungry =
tonight, had it not been for her, because he did not have money to buy food=
. <br></div><div><br></div><div>She asked with surprise, "You have come so =
far with any money? Where is your home? ETC ETC." On hearing his answers, s=
he asked, "So do you believe that your meeting me is due to the will of
 Ja=
gadamba?".</div><div> He replied, "Well at least on regarding the food, def=
initely!"</div><div>Bhairavi, "You people have petty minds, without any gai=
ns you don't listen to anything, you don't interact freely with others".</d=
iv><div><br></div><div>He asked," Are you a Tantrik?" She replied, "Yes. Wh=
at is your bhava?"</div><div>P, "I do not have fixed path, but I am very cu=
rious about Tantra and Shakti Sadhana. Can you ask you some questions about=
 Tantra? Can a person attain God through the path of Tantra?"<br></div><div=
><br></div><div>She sat down crosslegged in padmasana and replied, " The wo=
rd God means different things to different people. Then attaining God has e=
ven more different and complex meanings to everyone based on their own idea=
s. This is not like attaining some property or money. It can be attained by=
 various path, and then again it can attained by no-path at all. And the mo=
st complex thing in all this is what you refer to as God is not
 something =
that is to be possessed at all! Are you satisfied with the answer?"</div><d=
iv><br></div><div>P: "What is the aim of Tantrik sadhanas? What is the tang=
ible benefit? Those who are Tantriks or Siddha Kaulacharis, what do they ga=
in?"</div><div><br></div><div>Bhairavi, "Whoever does sadhana with whatever=
 intention, they will achieve that. But real Tantra-sadhana, which is vira-=
chara, is about becoming free from chains (pashas). Only when the chains ha=
ve been broken that divine Shakti is awakened in the body. Now if someone t=
hen uses this Divine Shakti for personal gains, then they head towards grea=
t calamity. Those who use it for the good of humanity, they become really d=
ivine".</div><div><br></div><div>Till now she was speaking calmly. Now P as=
ked, "But the answer that you gave seems like a riddle to me. Are you tryin=
g to imply that man cannot attain God through Tantra?"</div><div><br></div>=
<div>Bhairavi:"If you had been intelligent, you would not
 have asked this =
question. Forget about attaining God for the moment, first learn to acquire=
 shakti. Have you done that? Start immediately and by Bhagawati's grace you=
 will accomplish. This I can guarantee.  First become a Shaktiman, und=
erstand what is Shakti and how much Shakti you are capable of holding in yo=
ur body and mind. Understood? Don't waste your time in useless debates. Did=
 you understand what I am saying?"</div><div><br></div><div>The Bhairavi lo=
oked angry, the color of her face has suddenly changed and her eyes become =
still and unblinking. P felt scared. He kept quite. She continued:" All the=
se idiots having read a few books here and there have only learnt useless d=
ebates and time-wasting. Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Shaktihin (sans =
Shakti), medhahin (sans intellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you guys get kick=
ed from your bosses in office, and the come home and show off your impotenc=
y on your wives and mothers. And you want to debate
 on Shakti sadhana! Thi=
s is ridiculous!"</div><div><br></div><div>P got unnerved and was certain t=
hat she is a mad woman. The moment this thought came in his mind, she stood=
 up at a lightning pace and screamed back, " Oh you think I am mad? You don=
't know who I am. I can destroy you completely, or I can make you into a re=
al Shaktiman. Do you want to see?"</div><div><br></div><div>His mind became=
 stunned into silence. He did not know what to say. In fear, he looked down=
 at his own feet unable to make any conversation and started chanting the n=
ame of Krishna to save him. He wondered if he should now get up and run awa=
y from that place. Immediate she came over to where he was sitting and held=
 his shoulders, "Where will you run? Do you think you have the ability to e=
scape from me, without my willing it? I consider people like you nothing mo=
re than insects. You've left your wife and son and gone out roaming to pefo=
rm Dharma! You don't even know what Dharma
 means. An idiot of the first or=
der. People like you are sheep, not men. Escapists and cowards. Throw away =
all your bookish adwaitha into the Ganges. It's nonsense. Either do you kno=
w what is bhoga, nor do you know what is yoga, running away from life and b=
elieving that by escaping one attains to renunciation. No passion for life,=
 no passion for God. Dead decayed individuals. A sheep whose only contribut=
ion to life is to reproduce some more sheep and then run away from them. Id=
iot!"</div><div><br></div><div>In fear and shame the P felt like he would f=
aint any moment. For the first time in his wanderings he felt so depressed =
about himself that he did not know what to say. Like in a trance he felt hi=
s <br></div><div>vision was becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fall =
down on the floor, when the Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his shoul=
ders and said, "There is no renunciation or detachment from life in your he=
art and mind. How dare you argue and
 dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha awaits=
 you and you think you can escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Are=
 you free from desires of life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through yo=
u". He could not lift his eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt asham=
ed of himself and in a feeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her feet=
 and started crying, "Ma please save me.  You are right. I am an idiot=
, I am a coward, I am an escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and =
children at home. I am weak of mind and heart." His voice became choked wit=
h tears.</div><div><br></div><div>Hearing this the Bhairavi became silent. =
She held his chin with her right-hand and lifted up his face to the light. =
Her eyes had changed color and there was a tremendous compassion on her fac=
e. "What do you think I am? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from hell t=
o torment you, a raving mad woman?"<br></div><div><br></div><div>And P repl=
ied, "But I have not said
 anything to you like that, have I?". Hearing thi=
s she became furious with anger, "Will you people never become real men? Yo=
u think something in your heart and you lie through your teeth when asked. =
Don't you have any tej, shakti anything at all? Lying to escape situations?=
 Is this the character of real purush? Soft like mud who can be molded into=
 any obnoxious character when challenged by situations? And you think you c=
an learn vira-bhava of Bhairava? Fool! What do you do in life?"</div><div><=
br></div><div>P replied he was a painter before he left home. Hearing this =
her eyes widened in a childlike excitement. She lost her anger completely a=
nd asked," Can you draw me a picture? I have been searching for a good arti=
st? Can you draw a picture of Chinnamasta? I've not found anyone who can dr=
aw her properly".</div><div><br></div><div>P, "Printed pictures of Chinnama=
sta are easily available in the market for a very little price". Hearing th=
is she started
 roaring with laughter, "Printed in the markets you say? Hah=
! Chinnamasta? <br></div><div>Have you gone mad? <again laughter>."</=
div><div><br></div><div>P, "I find her image very violent and terrifying".<=
/div><div><br></div><div>Then the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud that it=
 sounded like a humkar, "Fool! For people like you who are worst than women=
, it is but natural that Chinnamasta will look scary and terrifying. People=
 who are scared at the first sight of blood and death will not appreciate h=
er beauty! Those who remain trapped in conditioned thinking of pap vs punya=
, sarga vs naraka, good vs bad, and other dualities cannot understand the m=
adness of Chinnamasta. You will only be able to draw a white Saraswati with=
 her beena and live trying to deny the other aspects and realities of life,=
 the death and the decay and never see the grand play of the Universe. For =
you and your ilk, a woman is an object of subconscious revulsion, you run s=
cared
 when you see the first woman approaching, you run away from your own=
 wife, how on earth can you handle the terrible beauty of Chinnamasta?"</di=
v><div><br></div><div>Then she pushed him with her hand. He fell on the flo=
or. She continued, "Go drown yourself in the Ganges and before doing so pra=
y to Jagadamba Durga that She may make you fit to hold shakti in your next =
life. Or at least beg Her, implore Her, that She may grant you intelligence=
 to understand what is Shakti-tattwa."</div><div><br></div><div>Hearing the=
se words, P was so depressed that his mind plunged into chaos and darkness.=
 Like in a state of debilitating trance, he got up from the floor and sat d=
own. The Bhairavi was not there in the room. He looked all around him. Then=
 he saw her on the road outside, walking towards the ganges. He cried out t=
o her, "Don't leave me here, I must know who you are. I am confused about l=
ife and everything else". As soon as he uttered these words, the room
 star=
ted reverberating with a attahasa, though there was not a soul present ther=
e apart from him. A laughter so loud that he left his ear drums will split.=
 He rushed out into the rain to follow the moving figure of the Bhairavi. T=
he faster he ran, the more did the distance keep increasing between him and=
 the Bhairavi. Then he could see clearly, the Bhairavi entering into the Ga=
nges water, and kept moving deeper until she was drowned completely in the =
water. The author sat near the banks, shouting out to her, asking her to co=
me out and help him. But there was no response. Just the regular lapping so=
und of waves hitting the shore and a very dark night. <br></div><div><br></=
div><div>He sat there till sunrise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. N=
ext morning he went and asked around the village, but no one had seen the B=
hairavi and neither was there any shop near the banks which sold food. Beca=
use of the heavy rains, everything was shut down last night
 with not a sou=
l in the open.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Years later, P went =
back home to his wife and son and lead a full and complete family life. I h=
ave merely narrated the incident as it is.<br></div><div><br></div><div>-Re=
