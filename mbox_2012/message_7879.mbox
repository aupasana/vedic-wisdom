IMO, what the priest did is absolutely wrong. I would not have spared him a=
nd would have protested that if I were witness to that.

Dear scholars,
=

I=C2=A0have a small doubt on priest's act i came across on shivrathr=

oja and perform all shodacha upachara samaskrams such as "suddhodaka snanam=
", arghyam, achamanam, etc to the maha linga. 
=C2=A0
My question is, once =
the water has been drunk by priest, would it be wise to use same vessel wat=

=C2=A0
Please clarify....
