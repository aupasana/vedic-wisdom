Very illumining article about the hidden meaning of the Devi Mahatmya. 

As=
 a beginner, I found it very useful. Others may want to skim though...the i=
deas are beautifully explained. It is an extract from a talk given at the D=
ivine Life Society (Sivananda Ashram, Rishikesh), presumably by Swami Chida=
nanda (doesn't say who the speaker is).

In summary, the article says:

Stages of spiritual=
 growth:

1. The obstacles- lust, anger, greed. Represented by Madhu and Ka=
itabha. 
The solution/saviour- intensive karma yoga. Represented by MahaKal=
i. 

In essence, the annihilation of Madhu and Kaitabha by Maha Kali, is th=
e removal of the impurities of lust, anger and greed by protracted karma yo=
ga. 


2. The obstacles- tossing of mind, and multiplying desires. Represen=
ted by Mahishasura and Raktabija.
The solution/saviour- worship of God. Rep=
resented by Maha Lakshmi.

In essence, worship of God bhakti yoga, allows u=
s to ovecome the tossing of mind and endless desires.

3. The last obstacle=
s- complacency with one's achievements, ignorance of what remains to be ach=
ieved. Represented by Shumba and Nishumba.
The solution/saviour- higher wis=
dom that comes after the previous two stages. Represented by Maha Saraswati=
. 

It also says we are not lonely pedestrians on the spiritual path. Every=
 one of us is supported by the cosmos, as we are intimitely connected with =
everything else! Apparantly even the smallest act has a significance. I fou=
nd that interesting. I have sometimes felt it's a long and lonesome road...=
.nice to think it isn't! :D

Om Sri Durgayai Namaha
