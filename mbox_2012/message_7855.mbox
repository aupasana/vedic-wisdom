Namaste,

I have gone through both of your postings thoroughly. I have a qu=
estion. Not on your explanation of jeevan Mukta but utility of a jeevan Muk=
ta.

Jeevan Mukta is the one whose chittas is completely emptied and there =
is no conditioning left.
1)Does it mean that a jeevan Mukta would not re-in=
carnate with a new body after the old body is dropped-off?

2) If the above=
 answer is Yes, then what would be the purpose of Indentifying with new bod=
y? In other words, if there is no conditioning left, what purpose a jeevan =
Mukta would serve in the objective world?

I do nit know if i was clear eno=
ugh to explain what i want to ask you.

Utpal
