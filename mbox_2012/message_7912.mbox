Dear Aswin, 
=C2=A0
Sin : Any action that makes you identify with the body =
is a sin
Any practice that makes you de-identify with the body is a spiritu=
al sadhana
=C2=A0
Hence using items for homam (- a practice to reduce your =
conditioning to I and Mine) is not a sin.
=C2=A0
Best Regards,
--Vinisha

=C2=A0 
If wasting food is a sin

then what about putting ghee/milk/=
puffed rice into havan kund

Regards
Aswin

Respect Sir,

If you had the time to read all the accepted Shastras and list down =
all the instructions given therein, you will realize it is impossible to sa=
tisfy all conditions. Infact, often they are contradictory. Why? Because ea=
ch shastras is powerful and valid for a particular time, place and cultural=
 setting. At one point it was considered leaving ones "desh" and crossing a=
n ocean was a terrific sin. What is "desh"? India the country did not exist=
. Ones village was ones desh and everything around, from the next village t=
o the end of the landmass was all "videsh". So if I apply that logic today,=
 how many people in this forum have already committed this great "sin"? Nea=
rly everyone. Because the settings have changed. 
=C2=A0
The Vedas are cons=
idered an eternal book, because the Veda samhitas contain descriptions of s=
piritual states in allegorical form. They are not a book=C2=A0of good ethic=
al living.=C2=A0Apart from the core-veda samhitas, all dharmic rulebooks ar=

e sense of right and wrong (discrimination)=C2=A0will develop in such a fas=
hion=C2=A0that you won't need sanction from anywhere,=C2=A0but your own sel=

Respected Sirs,
Namasthe,
To my knowledge, i=
 understand that, as per our scriptures=C2=A0one (grihasta)=C2=A0 should ta=
ke=C2=A0yhe food after serving the needy (Athithi). So one should wait for =
the arrival of guest before taking food & if non arrives the grihastha can =

of the shastras may kindly b advised.
With pranams,
Suryanarayanan.M
