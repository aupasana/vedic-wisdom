Namaste,

My sentiments exactly. I live in Toronto and visit a local temple every Saturday. At this temple, the most busiest areas are the Siva linga and murti os Sani bhagavan. Even though it is written near the murti of Sani bhagavan that daal and oil offerings should only be in small quantities, people just dump daal and oil and ultimately all of this is going to the garbage. 

Long time ago, I was following a practice of offering some food to birds. The birds would not usually come anywhere but close to where I lived at the time, a parking lot for Sears would see a lot of birds in early morning and that is where I used to go. Once I was amazed at what I saw, someone had dumped a whole sack of rice there...perhaps to feed the birds. I wondered than what was the point of such an exercise?

If these people were to put some little thought to what they were doing instead of making mindless offerings at the advice of some astrologer and perhaps offer the same to where it us needed, it would di a lot more good.

Regards,
Bhupendra
