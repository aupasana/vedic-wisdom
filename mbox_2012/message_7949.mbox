=C2=
=A0 
Om Harih Om
Namaste friends,

A lot of people asked in the past how to=
 know if they are making 
spiritual progress with their sadhana or not. Thi=
s is a loaded question, 
but I will share a few random thoughts on this and=
 several related 
topics. More than how to recognize spiritual progress, I =
will be writing 
on how NOT to try to recognize it!

If you don't like my 2=
 cents, kindly feel free to ignore me and follow 
your gurus and others who=
m you may prefer.

*        *        *

MATERIAL RESULTS

One obvious thing=
 is that some people get material benefits, like 
marriage, job, promotion,=
 childbirth etc. That reinforces or increases 
faith in the initial stages =
and makes one continue sadhana.

However, that may not happen to everyone. =
Moreover, such material 
results do not necessarily show spiritual progress=
. So, how do we 
identify spiritual progress?

*        *        *

GOAL OF=
 SADHANA

Spiritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterized=
 in 
scriptures. Though different scriptures may use different words, it al=
l 
boils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, 
attachme=
nts and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of the 
mind. How free=
 we are is indicated by how much we are able to resist and 
overcome this i=
nnate conditioning.

Maharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama in "Yoga Vaasishth=
am" that 
Self-realization means overcoming conditioning. Patanjali defined=
 Yoga 
(Communion with Self) in "Yoga Sutras" as "yogaH chitta vRtti nirodh=
aH" 
(Communion is resisting the working of conditioning).

This conditioni=
ng inflates ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, 
we can deflate the=
 ego completely and then identify with the entire 
universe, instead of a s=
ingle entity with a single agenda.

*        *        *

IDENTIFYING CONDIT=
IONING

Innate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what determines=
 our 
likes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (or dislike=
) 
some people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some things 
t=
hough our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to do) those 
thi=
ngs. All this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated 
over man=
y lives.

When someone praises us, we may know that it is irrelevant (our i=
nner 
voice tells us so) and yet we may feel elated. When someone puts us 
=
down, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner voice tells us so) 
and =
yet we may feel offended and feel like doing something about it. All 
this =
comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated over many 
lives.

Idne=
tifying the conditioning as it works on our instincts, thoughts, 
calculati=
ons and actions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. The key 
is to lear=
n to listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever the 
inner voice of =
conscience is telling us one thing and we are impelled 
from inside to do o=
therwise, we can conclude that that is the work of 
conditioning. We often =
suppress the inner voice of conscience and obey 
the inner voice of our con=
ditioning.

If we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller actions - physical o=
r mental 
- that go against the inner voice of conscience, it means our 
co=
nditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaningful measure of 
spi=
ritual progress. This may in general be difficult for others to 
judge, but=
 one can certainly judge for oneself.

The tricky thing is that our self-an=
alysis and self-judgment is also 
controlled by our conditioning!! Suppose =
I engaged in an action against 
my inner voice. Suppose I want to analyze w=
hat just happened and whether 
I violated my inner voice of conscience. Tha=
t whole process is governed 
by the conditioning too. Depending on how deep=
ly I am conditioned to 
think that I am a good person doing the right thing=
 and not making a 
mistake, my mind will be impelled to label the inner voi=
ce of conscience 
as a voice of confusion and not accord it any importance.=
 Instead, it 
will focus on the inner voice of conditioning (which shouts o=
ut from 
inside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclude that I d=
id the 
right thing.

The grip of conditioning is too tight to overcome in =
a day or two! But, 
the inner voice of conscience does tell everyone when o=
ne is doing 
something wrong under the influence of conditioning. If one ke=
eps 
trying, it can oneday help one identify and overcome conditioning.

* =
       *        *

SPECIAL EXPERIENCES

Sometimes, as one makes spiritual p=
rogress, one may have super-normal or 
mystical or out-of-body experiences,=
 visions and dreams.

For example, one person I know started to feel very l=
ight in the head 
with a vision of bright light of a particular color, when=
 he meditated 
with a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a=
 big fire at 
the base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire (=
he actually 
felt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific mantra=
. Another 
person saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity talked t=
o him. 
Interestingly, the same deity was seen by another person who was al=
so 
sitting there at the same time and that person had a totally different =

(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same deity at the same 
ti=
me. Another person felt like he became very light and was floating in 
air =
and there was an inexpressible happiness. In another case, one 
sadhaka whe=
n meditating was filled with the sense that his job was done 
on earth and =
he could now leave. He thought, "let me leave and let me 
take some more wi=
th me". He felt like he was a point moving up with a 
tremendous speed. At =
the same time, another person who was meditating a 
few feet away in front =
of a homam fire felt like somebody was pulling 
that person forcibly throug=
h a cave and felt really overwhelmed.

There are so many possible experienc=
es. But the key point is that 
experiences are secondary. They are NEITHER =
NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIENT for 
spiritual progress. I had my share of experie=
nces, progress and setbacks 
and I am 100% sure of the above. You'll do wel=
l to remember this 
sentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences or=
 desire them 
consciously or sub-consciously. I will elabate a little later=
 on the 
grave dangers of desiring experiences.

*        *        *

EXPER=
IENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION

We say that god can be known only by exper=
ience and not by reading 
books. That is not incorrect. However, when one i=
s deeply desirous of an 
experience, one may experience an aspect of god's =
Delusory Power instead 
of god and that may increase false pride (a true ex=
perience of god will 
instead produce infinite humility). Not all experienc=
es are equal.

There is a famous quote: An ounce of experience is better th=
an a ton of 
theory. Though that is true in a way, it is not complete. Even=
 a ton of 
experience is useless if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a t=
on of 
theory may actually be better if it actually reduces one's ego to a =

pound or an ounce!

The issue is not whether one needs practical experienc=
e or theoretical 
understanding. That is secondary. The primary thing is wh=
at is happening 
to one's ego. Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT is =
undoubtedly 
the main issue. If reading books, satsanga, rituals, theoretic=
al 
understanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a quintal, from a quintal to=
 
a pound and from a pound to an ounce, even without a direct experience, 
=
that's awesome. That is better than getting a ton of experience and ego 
be=
ing inflated from a pound to a quintal.

Though it is true that ego does no=
t become complete zero without an 
"experience" of god in the end, it is st=
ill a bad idea to seek that 
"experience" when one's ego is still a ton or =
a quintal. First reduce it 
to as small a quantity as you can. Experience o=
f god will then come by 
itself.

In the famous Indian movie "3 Idiots", th=
ere is a nice line: "Don't 
chase success, but chase capability. Success wi=
ll follow automatically." 
Similarly, don't chase experiences, but chase de=
tachment and deflation 
of ego. Experience will automatically follow. Chasi=
ng experience without 
trying to reduce ego is like putting the cart before=
 the horse. To use 
the analogy from the movie "3 Idiots", one then runs th=
e risk of 
becoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur Ramalingam (alias Si=
lencer) 
of that movie, who chased success, ended up with huge ego from lim=
ited 
success and failed in the end!

*        *        *

EXPERIENCE AND C=
ONDITIONING

As said above, it is a bad idea to seek an "experience" when o=
ne's ego 
is still a ton or a quintal. In other words, when one's condition=
ing is 
dense enough, a pre-occupation with experiences can be 
counter-pro=
ductive. The reason is that any experience will be 
interpreted (and absorb=
ed into one's system!!!) through the color of 
one's conditioning.

If I go=
 into the open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see 
that Sun is=
 orange. But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass 
windows of a hous=
e. Or suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through 
green eyeglasses. In=
 either case, I will see that Sun is green. I am 
experiencing the real Sun=
, but I will get the wrong knowledge that "Sun 
is green".

Similarly, even=
 a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN 
generate false know=
ledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one's conditioning is 
conducive (e.g. green =
eyeglasses!).

The key is not just to experience, but the ability to interp=
et, *digest* 
and absorb the experience into one's system well. One's condi=
tioning 
influences how one digests various life experiences, including spi=
ritual 
experiences and mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in=
 the 
above example!

*        *        *

DIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES

In ayu=
rvedic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic 
buildup in =
the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various 
tissues and =
create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look and 
feel healthy d=
espite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one 
develops serious =
diseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts 
of the body. The a=
ma may even interfere with the digestion of good food 
being taken in and t=
he working of even medicines one may take in. When 
too much ama has accumu=
lated and destabilizes the system, one may need 
to go through a painful de=
-toxification process.

Similarly, spiritual experiences one cannot digest =
well become spiritual 
ama, a toxic buildup in the subtle system. It can sl=
owly build up, get 
absorbed into various aspects of one's being and create=
 various diseases 
in the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look and=
 feel 
spiritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritua=
l 
ama accumulates, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can 
ev=
entually affect one's entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for 
de-tox=
ification) may be far more difficult than the physical 
pancha-karma.

*   =
     *        *

EXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS

To illustrate what I mean by spi=
ritual ama and delusions, let me give a 
*hypothetical* example.

Suppose s=
omeone sits still for a few hours everyday and meditates. 
Suppose one star=
ts to get some special inner experiences and some 
seemingly supernatural t=
hings start happening externally around one. 
Suppose these experiences giv=
e one the impression that one is special 
and one is making excellent spiri=
tual progress. Suppose one reads some 
spiritual books and fantasizes "beco=
ming like Shiva" mentioned in those 
books. Then one may start to think "ma=
y be, I have become like Shiva" 
and slowly convince oneself that one HAS b=
ecome like Shiva. Suppose one 
reads a spiritual book that claims "If one b=
ecomes like Shiva, the whole 
universe connives against one who causes an o=
ffense to him".

Of course, there is a context behind every statement and n=
o statement is 
absolute. If one misses the nuances, one may digest and abs=
orb it into 
one's system incorrectly. After all, one could have also said,=
 "if one 
becomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully co-operates with one=
 and 
there is no way anyone can really cause offense to that person".

Any=
way, one in the process of convincing oneself that one has indeed 
become l=
ike Shiva may then look for examples of someone causing offense 
and suffer=
ing bad things. Of course, just as one can find any shapes in 
clouds, one =
can find any correlations in things happening around one. 
One will find a =
few examples. That may reinforce the delusion that one 
has become like Shi=
va. When good and bad happen to people around one, 
one may start correlati=
ng them to good and bad done by those people to 
one and/or to things one h=
as done. Over time, the delusion may become so 
deep that it just feels so =
natural and obvious. This is like a serious 
disease developing from a toxi=
c buildup of undigested or badly digested 
food. Inability to fully underst=
and the spiritual experiences one had, 
the fantasy of becoming like Shiva,=
 the pre-exising pride (like 
pre-existing ama) and the not-so-well-digeste=
d notion that offense to 
Shiva causes harm, have together created spiritua=
l ama buildup that now 
resulted in a serious disease.

Though original exp=
eriences may have been genuine, experiences coming 
later on MAY be the res=
ult of accumulated delusions (disease) from the 
ill-digested experiences a=
nd notions (ama). Please note that ama is 
conducive to creating more ama. =
When unchecked, disease in one part of 
the system can spread to others.

A=
s said before, the key issue is: Is the ego getting inflated or 
deflated. =
If ego is getting inflated, then one is on the wrong track. 
One is either =
deluding oneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences due 
to pre-existing =
conditioning and delusions (spiritual ama). In either 
case, whatever one i=
s experiencing is not being digested well and is 
weakening the system inst=
ead of strengthening it. If, on the other hand, 
ego is getting deflated, t=
hen one is on the right track. Whatever one is 
experiencing is being diges=
ted well and strengthening the system.

*        *        *

SHAKTI, SIDDHI=
S AND MIRACLES

This emphasis on ego deflation may make some people wonder =
about the 
prominence given in some books to accumulation of shakti, siddhi=
s and 
miracles. For example, some books describe what a being like Shiva o=
r 
someone less but still with high enough shakti, can do.

Yes, SOME enlig=
htened beings or some beings close to enlightenment MAY 
have a lot of spir=
itual shakti and be able to do some special things. 
But, no book said that=
 you get those abilities by being proud or 
pursuing something that can mak=
e one proud.

In fact, if one looks at those abilities described in books a=
nd adores 
them from one's *current* levels of dense conditioning, it is qu=
ite akin 
to looking at a "green Sun" from green eyeglasses and admiring th=
e 
greenness of that Sun!!! In other words, one has missed the whole point.=
 
One with dense conditioning can't even understand what that shakti or 
ab=
ility really means or comes from. In order to understand what shakti 
is, t=
o accumulate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one MUST 
deflate one'=
s ego.

Bottomline is this: Most scriptures of most religions are unanimous=
 in 
teaching the importance of humility, compassion and ego deflation. No =

scripture talks about the glory of pride and ego inflation. It's as 
simpl=
e as that.

*        *        *

GODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS & CONVERSATIONS

=
We encounter some people who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses 
a=
nd also conversations with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime 
com=
ing from the divine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine 
beings=
 supposedly said is well within what one consciously or 
sub-consciously al=
ready knew or believed or wanted to believe.

This may remind one of the en=
counters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character 
played by Sanjay Dutt in hit b=
ollywood movie "Lage Rahe Munnabhai". In 
that movie, the visions are due t=
o "chemical imbalance" in Munnabhai's 
mind and the Gandhi he sees and can =
talk to, cannot answer questions 
that Munnabhai himself does not know (but=
 real Gandhi should know). So 
the conclusion is that the person Munnabhai =
imagines seeing is a 
character in his own mind constructed based on what M=
unnabhai 
understands of Gandhi.

In the case of divine encounters, it may =
be a little different from this 
movie. It MAY be a divine being one truly =
fancied meeting based on all 
that one consciously and sub-consciously knew=
 already, OR it may be a 
real being. Even in the latter case, the being an=
d his/her actions are 
interpreted strictly based on one's conditioning, li=
ke the "green Sun" 
in our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, =
what divine 
beings say fits well within the realm of knowledge one conscio=
usly or 
sub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.

In=
 the rare case of a sadhaka with very little conditioning having a 
real di=
vine encounter, it is like an innocent child meeting mother or 
father, and=
 there is a real flow of divine and sublime understanding and 
wisdom.

Aga=
in, the key is not to see a god or a goddess, but to be 
de-conditioned eno=
ugh to really benefit from it!

*        *        *

KUNDALINI AWAKENING & =
RISE

One more thing people often talk about is Kundalini awakening and ris=
e. 
Kundalini shakti is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this =

is "I"). Kundalini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra means one does not 
e=
ven question who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties 
se=
lf down to the physical body and physical senses. However, 
self-awareness =
rising above this does not necessarily mean spiritual 
progress or enlighte=
nment. Kundalini awakening is only the beginning of 
a long process. If one=
's conditioning is deeply holding down to subtle 
ideas of who one is (e.g.=
 I am a great spiritual soul who saved the 
world many times in the past an=
d came back to save it), an awakened 
Kundalini may take one's notion of se=
lf beyond the physical body, but 
will get stuck somewhere else. In fact, o=
ne's subtle notions of self may 
become aggrandized when Kundalini reaches =
conducive regions and one may 
experience things that aggravate and strengt=
hen those notions. One may 
get badly stuck.

As mentioned above, any spiri=
tual experience can create spiritual ama 
when not digested properly. Any p=
re-existing conditioning may make it 
difficult to digest anything complex.=
 Instead of eating a heavy-duty 
protein bar that one cannot digest and get=
ting toxic buildup in the 
system, one is better off eating simple food tha=
t one's own system can 
process and digest well.

To be clear, whether one'=
s Kundalini is awakened or not, and where one's 
Kundalini is currently, is=
 NOT a measure of one's spiritual progress. As 
Kundalini does not rise thr=
ough a single path, as the rise is not linear 
and as the obstructions are =
not uniform in all people, one cannot 
compare two people based on Kundalin=
i experiences.

One can cling to the body and overcome all conditioning slo=
wly and 
oneday Kundalini may awaken and rise all the way to Sahasrara. Ano=
ther 
person may awaken Kundalini and it may get stuck somewhere where it i=
s 
extremely difficult to overcome the corresponding conditioning.

The bot=
tomline is that how much conditioning is overcome and how reduced 
one's eg=
o is is the correct measure of spiritual progress and not 
whether Kundalin=
i is awakened and where Kundalini is.

*        *        *

CORRELATIONS GA=
LORE

Do not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that may or ma=
y 
not mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, "wow, I was 
=
just thinking about you". Or suppose you say something and someone says, 
"=
wow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as though you read 
my m=
ind." Suppose you were unhappy with the happenings in some region of 
the w=
orld, did a special sadhana and suppose something bad happened 
there. Or s=
uppose you had a desire at the back of your mind, did some 
sadhana and the=
 desire was fulfilled.

In several such cases, correlating a result with so=
mething you did can 
often increase pride and your sense of self-worth. And=
, doing that will 
not enable you to do your dharma any better.

Keep think=
ing your thoughts and desires, keep doing your actions and 
keep doing your=
 sadhana. That's it. Don't correlate actions and results 
and think that yo=
u made X or Y result happen. We engage in actions and 
god gives results. T=
he sense of "I made X happen" is conducive to pride 
and ego inflation. Mor=
eover, you can *never* know *for sure* whether 
action A or B caused result=
 X or Y, because the action-result pipeline 
has variable delay!! So, why e=
ven bother to correlate and run the risk 
of ego inflation?

*        *    =
    *

BOTTOMLINE

Don't run after special experiences and special abilitie=
s or anything 
that makes you special (as you imagine currently, based on y=
our dense 
conditioning). Spiritual progress is not about becoming "special=
", but 
about becoming humble. Special experiences and abilities do not mat=
ter 
at all. In fact, they can distract one and give false pride. God makes=
 
one special AFTER one sheds pride completely or almost completely.

Also,=
 stop correlating things happening to or around you, with your 
actions, an=
d think that you caused events X or Y. Engaging in actions is 
your sacred =
duty and giving whatever results are fit at a given time is 
god's prerogat=
ive. That is the simplest and safest model one can imbibe 
in one's thinkin=
g.

Remember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful measure of 
spiri=
tual progress is how deflated your ego is and how humble you become 
(not h=
ow humble you act or behave, but how humble you have really become 
interna=
lly). It is how well you are able to resist the temptations of 
following t=
he voice of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and how 
well you can fo=
llow the voice of conscience.

When inflations in ego occur, it is the job =
of a guru/mentor to notice 
it, bring it to the attention and perhaps even =
be ruthless in belling 
the cat [of ego]. But most gurus now-a-days may not=
 do that well. So, 
you have to do your best to avoid any serious ego infla=
tions.

Unfortunately, the path of spiritual progress and self-realization =
IS 
very very very likely for most of us to include many many many 
opportu=
nities for very very very serious ego inflation! So keep a strict 
watch on=
 your ego.

<br>
A lot of people asked in the past how to know if they are making=
 <br>
spiritual progress with their sadhana or not. This is a loaded questi=
on, <br>
but I will share a few random thoughts on this and several related=
 <br>
topics. More than how to recognize spiritual progress, I will be writ=
ing <br>
on how NOT to try to recognize it!<br>

 whom you may prefer.<br>

MATERIAL RESULT=
S<br>
<br>
One obvious thing is that some people get material benefits, lik=
e <br>
marriage, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That reinforces or increas=
es <br>
faith in the initial stages and makes one continue sadhana.<br>
<br=
>
However, that may not happen to everyone. Moreover, such material <br>
re=
sults do not necessarily show spiritual progress. So, how do we <br>
identi=
fy spiritual progress?<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
GOAL OF SADHAN=
A<br>
<br>
Spiritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterize=
d in <br>
scriptures. Though different scriptures may use different words, =
it all <br>
boils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, =
<br>
attachments and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of the <b=
r>
mind. How free we are is indicated by how much we are able to resist and=
 <br>
overcome this innate conditioning.<br>
<br>
Maharshi Vasishtha taught=
 Lord Rama in "Yoga Vaasishtham" that <br>
Self-realization means overcomin=
g conditioning. Patanjali defined Yoga <br>
(Communion with Self) in "Yoga =
Sutras" as "yogaH chitta vRtti nirodhaH" <br>
(Communion is resisting the w=
orking of conditioning).<br>
<br>
This conditioning inflates ego and by ove=
rcoming all the conditioning, <br>
we can deflate the ego completely and th=
en identify with the entire <br>
universe, instead of a single entity with =
a single agenda.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
IDENTIFYING CONDITIO=
NING<br>
<br>
Innate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what dete=
rmines our <br>
likes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (=
or dislike) <br>
some people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) =
some things <br>
though our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or=
 to do) those <br>
things. All this comes from conditioning, which has been=
 accumulated <br>
over many lives.<br>
<br>
When someone praises us, we may=
 know that it is irrelevant (our inner <br>
voice tells us so) and yet we m=
ay feel elated. When someone puts us <br>
down, we may know that it is irre=
levant (our inner voice tells us so) <br>
and yet we may feel offended and =
feel like doing something about it. All <br>
this comes from conditioning, =
which has been accumulated over many <br>
lives.<br>
<br>
Idnetifying the c=
onditioning as it works on our instincts, thoughts, <br>
calculations and a=
ctions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. The key <br>
is to learn to =
listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever the <br>
inner voice of c=
onscience is telling us one thing and we are impelled <br>
from inside to d=
o otherwise, we can conclude that that is the work of <br>
conditioning. We=
 often suppress the inner voice of conscience and obey <br>
the inner voice=
 of our conditioning.<br>
<br>
If we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller a=
ctions - physical or mental <br>
- that go against the inner voice of consc=
ience, it means our <br>
conditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only=
 meaningful measure of <br>
spiritual progress. This may in general be diff=
icult for others to <br>
judge, but one can certainly judge for oneself.<br=
>
<br>
The tricky thing is that our self-analysis and self-judgment is also=
 <br>
controlled by our conditioning!! Suppose I engaged in an action again=
st <br>
my inner voice. Suppose I want to analyze what just happened and wh=
ether <br>
I violated my inner voice of conscience. That whole process is g=
overned <br>
by the conditioning too. Depending on how deeply I am conditio=
ned to <br>
think that I am a good person doing the right thing and not mak=
ing a <br>
mistake, my mind will be impelled to label the inner voice of co=
nscience <br>
as a voice of confusion and not accord it any importance. Ins=
tead, it <br>
will focus on the inner voice of conditioning (which shouts o=
ut from <br>
inside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclude that=
 I did the <br>
right thing.<br>
<br>
The grip of conditioning is too tight=
 to overcome in a day or two! But, <br>
the inner voice of conscience does =
tell everyone when one is doing <br>
something wrong under the influence of=
 conditioning. If one keeps <br>
trying, it can oneday help one identify an=
d overcome conditioning.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
SPECIAL EXPE=
RIENCES<br>
<br>
Sometimes, as one makes spiritual progress, one may have s=
uper-normal or <br>
mystical or out-of-body experiences, visions and dreams=
.<br>
<br>
For example, one person I know started to feel very light in the=
 head <br>
with a vision of bright light of a particular color, when he med=
itated <br>
with a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a bi=
g fire at <br>
the base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire =
(he actually <br>
felt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific m=
antra. Another <br>
person saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity=
 talked to him. <br>
Interestingly, the same deity was seen by another pers=
on who was also <br>
sitting there at the same time and that person had a t=
otally different <br>
(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same =
deity at the same <br>
time. Another person felt like he became very light =
and was floating in <br>
air and there was an inexpressible happiness. In a=
nother case, one <br>
sadhaka when meditating was filled with the sense tha=
t his job was done <br>
on earth and he could now leave. He thought, "let m=
e leave and let me <br>
take some more with me". He felt like he was a poin=
t moving up with a <br>
tremendous speed. At the same time, another person =
who was meditating a <br>
few feet away in front of a homam fire felt like =
somebody was pulling <br>
that person forcibly through a cave and felt real=
ly overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
There are so many possible experiences. But the ke=
y point is that <br>
experiences are secondary. They are NEITHER NECESSARY =
NOR SUFFICIENT for <br>
spiritual progress. I had my share of experiences, =
progress and setbacks <br>
and I am 100% sure of the above. You'll do well =
to remember this <br>
sentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences =
or desire them <br>
consciously or sub-consciously. I will elabate a little=
 later on the <br>
grave dangers of desiring experiences.<br>
<br>
*       =
 *        *<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION<br>
<br>
We say t=
hat god can be known only by experience and not by reading <br>
books. That=
 is not incorrect. However, when one is deeply desirous of an <br>
experien=
ce, one may experience an aspect of god's Delusory Power instead <br>
of go=
d and that may increase false pride (a true experience of god will <br>
ins=
tead produce infinite humility). Not all experiences are equal.<br>
<br>
Th=
ere is a famous quote: An ounce of experience is better than a ton of <br>
=
theory. Though that is true in a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of <br=
>
experience is useless if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a ton of <br=
>
theory may actually be better if it actually reduces one's ego to a <br>
=
pound or an ounce!<br>
<br>
The issue is not whether one needs practical ex=
perience or theoretical <br>
understanding. That is secondary. The primary =
thing is what is happening <br>
to one's ego. Is it getting inflated or def=
lated? THAT is undoubtedly <br>
the main issue. If reading books, satsanga,=
 rituals, theoretical <br>
understanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a qui=
ntal, from a quintal to <br>
a pound and from a pound to an ounce, even wit=
hout a direct experience, <br>
that's awesome. That is better than getting =
a ton of experience and ego <br>
being inflated from a pound to a quintal.<=
br>
<br>
Though it is true that ego does not become complete zero without a=
n <br>
"experience" of god in the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that =
<br>
"experience" when one's ego is still a ton or a quintal. First reduce =
it <br>
to as small a quantity as you can. Experience of god will then come=
 by <br>
itself.<br>
<br>
In the famous Indian movie "3 Idiots", there is a=
 nice line: "Don't <br>
chase success, but chase capability. Success will f=
ollow automatically." <br>
Similarly, don't chase experiences, but chase de=
tachment and deflation <br>
of ego. Experience will automatically follow. C=
hasing experience without <br>
trying to reduce ego is like putting the car=
t before the horse. To use <br>
the analogy from the movie "3 Idiots", one =
then runs the risk of <br>
becoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur Rama=
lingam (alias Silencer) <br>
of that movie, who chased success, ended up wi=
th huge ego from limited <br>
success and failed in the end!<br>
<br>
*    =
    *        *<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING<br>
<br>
As said above,=
 it is a bad idea to seek an "experience" when one's ego <br>
is still a to=
n or a quintal. In other words, when one's conditioning is <br>
dense enoug=
h, a pre-occupation with experiences can be <br>
counter-productive. The re=
ason is that any experience will be <br>
interpreted (and absorbed into one=
's system!!!) through the color of <br>
one's conditioning.<br>
<br>
If I g=
o into the open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see <br>
that S=
un is orange. But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass <br>
windows =
of a house. Or suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through <br>
green e=
yeglasses. In either case, I will see that Sun is green. I am <br>
experien=
cing the real Sun, but I will get the wrong knowledge that "Sun <br>
is gre=
en".<br>
<br>
Similarly, even a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing S=
un!) CAN <br>
generate false knowledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one's condit=
ioning is <br>
conducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).<br>
<br>
The key is not =
just to experience, but the ability to interpet, *digest* <br>
and absorb t=
he experience into one's system well. One's conditioning <br>
influences ho=
w one digests various life experiences, including spiritual <br>
experience=
s and mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in the <br>
above ex=
ample!<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
DIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES<br>
<=
br>
In ayurvedic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic <b=
r>
buildup in the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various=
 <br>
tissues and create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look a=
nd <br>
feel healthy despite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, =
one <br>
develops serious diseases. The disease starts to spread to various=
 parts <br>
of the body. The ama may even interfere with the digestion of g=
ood food <br>
being taken in and the working of even medicines one may take=
 in. When <br>
too much ama has accumulated and destabilizes the system, on=
e may need <br>
to go through a painful de-toxification process.<br>
<br>
S=
imilarly, spiritual experiences one cannot digest well become spiritual <br=
>
ama, a toxic buildup in the subtle system. It can slowly build up, get <b=
r>
absorbed into various aspects of one's being and create various diseases=
 <br>
in the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look and feel <br>
sp=
iritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritual <br>
am=
a accumulates, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can <br>
eve=
ntually affect one's entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for <br>
de-=
toxification) may be far more difficult than the physical <br>
pancha-karma=
.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS<br>
<br>
T=
o illustrate what I mean by spiritual ama and delusions, let me give a <br>=

*hypothetical* example.<br>
<br>
Suppose someone sits still for a few hour=
s everyday and meditates. <br>
Suppose one starts to get some special inner=
 experiences and some <br>
seemingly supernatural things start happening ex=
ternally around one. <br>
Suppose these experiences give one the impression=
 that one is special <br>
and one is making excellent spiritual progress. S=
uppose one reads some <br>
spiritual books and fantasizes "becoming like Sh=
iva" mentioned in those <br>
books. Then one may start to think "may be, I =
have become like Shiva" <br>
and slowly convince oneself that one HAS becom=
e like Shiva. Suppose one <br>
reads a spiritual book that claims "If one b=
ecomes like Shiva, the whole <br>
universe connives against one who causes =
an offense to him".<br>
<br>
Of course, there is a context behind every sta=
tement and no statement is <br>
absolute. If one misses the nuances, one ma=
y digest and absorb it into <br>
one's system incorrectly. After all, one c=
ould have also said, "if one <br>
becomes like Shiva, the whole universe fu=
lly co-operates with one and <br>
there is no way anyone can really cause o=
ffense to that person".<br>
<br>
Anyway, one in the process of convincing o=
neself that one has indeed <br>
become like Shiva may then look for example=
s of someone causing offense <br>
and suffering bad things. Of course, just=
 as one can find any shapes in <br>
clouds, one can find any correlations i=
n things happening around one. <br>
One will find a few examples. That may =
reinforce the delusion that one <br>
has become like Shiva. When good and b=
ad happen to people around one, <br>
one may start correlating them to good=
 and bad done by those people to <br>
one and/or to things one has done. Ov=
er time, the delusion may become so <br>
deep that it just feels so natural=
 and obvious. This is like a serious <br>
disease developing from a toxic b=
uildup of undigested or badly digested <br>
food. Inability to fully unders=
tand the spiritual experiences one had, <br>
the fantasy of becoming like S=
hiva, the pre-exising pride (like <br>
pre-existing ama) and the not-so-wel=
l-digested notion that offense to <br>
Shiva causes harm, have together cre=
ated spiritual ama buildup that now <br>
resulted in a serious disease.<br>=

<br>
Though original experiences may have been genuine, experiences coming=
 <br>
later on MAY be the result of accumulated delusions (disease) from th=
e <br>
ill-digested experiences and notions (ama). Please note that ama is =
<br>
conducive to creating more ama. When unchecked, disease in one part of=
 <br>
the system can spread to others.<br>
<br>
As said before, the key iss=
ue is: Is the ego getting inflated or <br>
deflated. If ego is getting infl=
ated, then one is on the wrong track. <br>
One is either deluding oneself o=
r ill-digesting genuine experiences due <br>
to pre-existing conditioning a=
nd delusions (spiritual ama). In either <br>
case, whatever one is experien=
cing is not being digested well and is <br>
weakening the system instead of=
 strengthening it. If, on the other hand, <br>
ego is getting deflated, the=
n one is on the right track. Whatever one is <br>
experiencing is being dig=
ested well and strengthening the system.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<=
br>
SHAKTI, SIDDHIS AND MIRACLES<br>
<br>
This emphasis on ego deflation ma=
y make some people wonder about the <br>
prominence given in some books to =
accumulation of shakti, siddhis and <br>
miracles. For example, some books =
describe what a being like Shiva or <br>
someone less but still with high e=
nough shakti, can do.<br>
<br>
Yes, SOME enlightened beings or some beings =
close to enlightenment MAY <br>
have a lot of spiritual shakti and be able =
to do some special things. <br>
But, no book said that you get those abilit=
ies by being proud or <br>
pursuing something that can make one proud.<br>
=
<br>
In fact, if one looks at those abilities described in books and adores=
 <br>
them from one's *current* levels of dense conditioning, it is quite a=
kin <br>
to looking at a "green Sun" from green eyeglasses and admiring the=
 <br>
greenness of that Sun!!! In other words, one has missed the whole poi=
nt. <br>
One with dense conditioning can't even understand what that shakti=
 or <br>
ability really means or comes from. In order to understand what sh=
akti <br>
is, to accumulate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one MUS=
T <br>
deflate one's ego.<br>
<br>
Bottomline is this: Most scriptures of m=
ost religions are unanimous in <br>
teaching the importance of humility, co=
mpassion and ego deflation. No <br>
scripture talks about the glory of prid=
e and ego inflation. It's as <br>
simple as that.<br>
<br>
*        *      =
  *<br>
<br>
GODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS & CONVERSATIONS<br>
<br>
We encou=
nter some people who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses <br>
and a=
lso conversations with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime <br>
com=
ing from the divine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine <br>
be=
ings supposedly said is well within what one consciously or <br>
sub-consci=
ously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.<br>
<br>
This may remi=
nd one of the encounters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character <br>
played by =
Sanjay Dutt in hit bollywood movie "Lage Rahe Munnabhai". In <br>
that movi=
e, the visions are due to "chemical imbalance" in Munnabhai's <br>
mind and=
 the Gandhi he sees and can talk to, cannot answer questions <br>
that Munn=
abhai himself does not know (but real Gandhi should know). So <br>
the conc=
lusion is that the person Munnabhai imagines seeing is a <br>
character in =
his own mind constructed based on what Munnabhai <br>
understands of Gandhi=
.<br>
<br>
In the case of divine encounters, it may be a little different f=
rom this <br>
movie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fancied meeting bas=
ed on all <br>
that one consciously and sub-consciously knew already, OR it=
 may be a <br>
real being. Even in the latter case, the being and his/her a=
ctions are <br>
interpreted strictly based on one's conditioning, like the =
"green Sun" <br>
in our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, wha=
t divine <br>
beings say fits well within the realm of knowledge one consci=
ously or <br>
sub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe=
.<br>
<br>
In the rare case of a sadhaka with very little conditioning havi=
ng a <br>
real divine encounter, it is like an innocent child meeting mothe=
r or <br>
father, and there is a real flow of divine and sublime understand=
ing and <br>
wisdom.<br>
<br>
Again, the key is not to see a god or a godde=
ss, but to be <br>
de-conditioned enough to really benefit from it!<br>

self down to the physical body and physical senses. However, <br>
self-=
awareness rising above this does not necessarily mean spiritual <br>
progre=
ss or enlightenment. Kundalini awakening is only the beginning of <br>
a lo=
ng process. If one's conditioning is deeply holding down to subtle <br>
ide=
as of who one is (e.g. I am a great spiritual soul who saved the <br>
world=
 many times in the past and came back to save it), an awakened <br>
Kundali=
ni may take one's notion of self beyond the physical body, but <br>
will ge=
t stuck somewhere else. In fact, one's subtle notions of self may <br>
beco=
me aggrandized when Kundalini reaches conducive regions and one may <br>
ex=
perience things that aggravate and strengthen those notions. One may <br>
g=
et badly stuck.<br>
<br>
As mentioned above, any spiritual experience can c=
reate spiritual ama <br>
when not digested properly. Any pre-existing condi=
tioning may make it <br>
difficult to digest anything complex. Instead of e=
ating a heavy-duty <br>
protein bar that one cannot digest and getting toxi=
c buildup in the <br>
system, one is better off eating simple food that one=
's own system can <br>
process and digest well.<br>
<br>
To be clear, wheth=
er one's Kundalini is awakened or not, and where one's <br>
Kundalini is cu=
rrently, is NOT a measure of one's spiritual progress. As <br>
Kundalini do=
es not rise through a single path, as the rise is not linear <br>
and as th=
e obstructions are not uniform in all people, one cannot <br>
compare two p=
eople based on Kundalini experiences.<br>
<br>
One can cling to the body an=
d overcome all conditioning slowly and <br>
oneday Kundalini may awaken and=
 rise all the way to Sahasrara. Another <br>
person may awaken Kundalini an=
d it may get stuck somewhere where it is <br>
extremely difficult to overco=
me the corresponding conditioning.<br>
<br>
The bottomline is that how much=
 conditioning is overcome and how reduced <br>
one's ego is is the correct =
measure of spiritual progress and not <br>
whether Kundalini is awakened an=
d where Kundalini is.<br>

CORRELATIONS GA=
LORE<br>
<br>
Do not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that m=
ay or may <br>
not mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, "=
wow, I was <br>
just thinking about you". Or suppose you say something and =
someone says, <br>
"wow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as t=
hough you read <br>
my mind." Suppose you were unhappy with the happenings =
in some region of <br>
the world, did a special sadhana and suppose somethi=
ng bad happened <br>
there. Or suppose you had a desire at the back of your=
 mind, did some <br>
sadhana and the desire was fulfilled.<br>
<br>
In seve=
ral such cases, correlating a result with something you did can <br>
often =
increase pride and your sense of self-worth. And, doing that will <br>
not =
enable you to do your dharma any better.<br>
<br>
Keep thinking your though=
ts and desires, keep doing your actions and <br>
keep doing your sadhana. T=
hat's it. Don't correlate actions and results <br>
and think that you made =
X or Y result happen. We engage in actions and <br>
god gives results. The =
sense of "I made X happen" is conducive to pride <br>
and ego inflation. Mo=
reover, you can *never* know *for sure* whether <br>
action A or B caused r=
esult X or Y, because the action-result pipeline <br>
has variable delay!! =
So, why even bother to correlate and run the risk <br>
of ego inflation?<br=
>

<br>
BOTTOMLINE<br>
<br>
Don't run after spe=
cial experiences and special abilities or anything <br>
that makes you spec=
ial (as you imagine currently, based on your dense <br>
conditioning). Spir=
itual progress is not about becoming "special", but <br>
about becoming hum=
ble. Special experiences and abilities do not matter <br>
at all. In fact, =
they can distract one and give false pride. God makes <br>
one special AFTE=
R one sheds pride completely or almost completely.<br>
<br>
Also, stop corr=
elating things happening to or around you, with your <br>
actions, and thin=
k that you caused events X or Y. Engaging in actions is <br>
your sacred du=
ty and giving whatever results are fit at a given time is <br>
god's prerog=
ative. That is the simplest and safest model one can imbibe <br>
in one's t=
hinking.<br>
<br>
Remember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful mea=
sure of <br>
spiritual progress is how deflated your ego is and how humble =
you become <br>
(not how humble you act or behave, but how humble you have =
really become <br>
internally). It is how well you are able to resist the t=
emptations of <br>
following the voice of your conditioning (which inflates=
 ego) and how <br>
well you can follow the voice of conscience.<br>
<br>
Wh=
en inflations in ego occur, it is the job of a guru/mentor to notice <br>
i=
t, bring it to the attention and perhaps even be ruthless in belling <br>
t=
he cat [of ego]. But most gurus now-a-days may not do that well. So, <br>
y=
ou have to do your best to avoid any serious ego inflations.<br>
<br>
Unfor=
tunately, the path of spiritual progress and self-realization IS <br>
very =
very very likely for most of us to include many many many <br>
opportunitie=
s for very very very serious ego inflation! So keep a strict <br>
watch on =
your ego.<br>
