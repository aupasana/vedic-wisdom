Hi,

I recently discovered Swami Omkarananda's writings (he is a disciple o=
f Swami Sivananda), and enjoyed reading this one. Thought I would share it =
with you as he suggests a rather nice practical technique to increase God r=
ememberance that might suit some of you (The "child of God" exercise in par=
ticular).  

Excerpts from Swami Omkarananda's article "The shortest way to=
 God experience":

"Let your heart constantly beat with the thought, 'God, =
God, God', God all the twenty-four hours of the day, God as Love, God as Li=
ght, God as Omnipotence, God as Omniscience, God as Peace, God as unlimited=
 Happiness, God as infinite Blessedness, God as an all-seeing Presence, God=
 as an all-loving Father, God as an indestructible, eternal, absolute Truth=
, God as Beauty, Protection, Strength. Let your heart constantly beat with =
these words. This is the shortest way to God-Experience."

"If you greet so=
meone, greet God in that someone. If you sleep, feel the bed to be the Hear=
t of God. If you are about to eat something, first offer it to God, mentall=
y, and take it as a service to God, as an adoration of God, as a duty you o=
we to God by maintaining the body in order that, through the body, you may =
make spiritual progress."

AN EXERCISE: "I am a child of God"

"One of the =
most wonderful ways of God-experience in daily life, is to constantly tell =
your heart, 'I am a child of God'. Again and again, let your whole being, y=
our entire soul, affirm, 'I am a child of God. God is all around me. I am i=
n God even as everyone and everything is in God. God is in me, even as God =
is in everyone and in everything'."

"God has endowed you with endless inne=
r spiritual qualities, by forming you in His own living Image of divine Con=
sciousness. Displace human hatred by His divine Love, displace human worry =
by the divine Strength. As an inspiring, joy-giving, brave, blessed child o=
f God be thou, here in this difficult world."

"This fact that you are a ch=
ild of God is the greatest truth. Upon it rest all other truths. It is the =
truth of truths."

"That you are a child of matter, or a creature of nature=
, is not the central truth: it is merely a temporary fact, which is constan=
tly altering its face and will soon disappear as the bubble on the sea. Mat=
ter is changing, therefore, your material body too is changing, so are your=
 thoughts and feelings changing. The Breath of God in you, the Light in you=
 as the child of God, does not change. It is the same in all conditions and=
 at all times. It is the imperishable and all-wonderful Substance of God in=
 you. Matter perishes. The real child of God in you, which is your real, et=
ernal, inner divine Self and Being, which is the wonderful 'You', does not =
perish. Therefore, always permit your inner heart to say, 'I am a child of =
God.' Breathe, and bless the world with the treasures of your good works, a=
s a child of God."

The full article is worth a read
