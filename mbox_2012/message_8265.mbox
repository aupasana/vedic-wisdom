thi homam is capable of giving everything. Because we worship Ganapathi in =
the beginning of every homam, people look at Ganapathi homam as an "appetiz=
er" and Chandi homam etc as the "full meal". That's not correct. Even Ganap=
athi homam can be a "full meal". What makes a homam complete is the love, s=
urrender and feeling for the deity in your heart.
