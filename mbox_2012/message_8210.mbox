Dear Sunil,

> Homa is not like reciting another mantra, it has to be according to the
rules.


Everything in our tradition has rules and mantras. How to eat. What to eat.
When to eat. How to wash your hands after you eat. How many times should
you shake your hands to dry them off after you eat. How to do homa. Etc.

But, here's the kicker. There isn't one single set of rules. There are many
contradicting sets of rules. So, doing anything according to "the" rules is
simply not possible. The reality is that there are a set of timeless
principles, which have been laid down as many sets of rules.

Many of the people in this list are doing homa according to rules. They may
not be the same rules that you are following, but that most certainly does
not mean that they are rule-less :-)


> wrong pronunciation is very dangerous.
> In the airforce, you need to have great experience flying a sports/small
aircraft,


Our rishis are geniuses. They put in a few safeguards. The intent of the
rules, and basic things like pronunciation is akin to putting the key in
the plane. Without it, nothing happens, and we can all pretend to fly the
plane. As long as we are pretending, it doesn't matter if it is a small
plane, or a military jet. It is all totally harmless.

Frankly, "correct pronunciation" is hard. I know basic sanskrit. I have
worked on my pronunciation, and it is decent. I have even studied a little
bit of the shAstra that underlies pronunciation. And I know that I am
nowhere close to "correct pronunciation". Honestly, I have yet to meet a
single person with perfect pronunciation. But, I have met some people who
are great sAdhakas, who are much furthur along the spiritual path that me.

Here's another way of thinking about it. Riding a bike incorrectly is very
dangerous. If you go too fast, you will fall and get hurt. If you go too
slow, you will fall and get hurt. If you don't look ahead, you will hit
something and get hurt. And yet, we all teach our children how to ride
bikes. Every one of them makes every one of these mistakes. But, that is
how they learn.

Fundamentally, things like homa, japa, tarpana, dhyana etc are mandated in
the shastras from a young age. Our munis would not have prescribed these
for young children if they were dangerous. We all know -- children do
everything wrong before they do it right. The rishis have taken this into
account. In the spiritual path, we are all children.

sasneham,
