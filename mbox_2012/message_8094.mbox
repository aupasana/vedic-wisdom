here are common path of sadhana, what a Hindu or Muslin both respects... th=
e path of which Lalon Fakir taught... that is nothing but "Kundalini Sadhan=
a"...

lk songs are very informative on the sadhana too... here is a link from wik=
ipedia...

 I had an idea how fast the woods were burning. So while I was moving with =
the homam, I knew that with a big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire w=

 - 1) Would you have any suggestion how can I make the fire last long so th=

 homams for others and I always directly felt a strong effect working on me=
 also.

w why, because it was a super-short homam, with many mantras left. Also, I =
should honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva=
 in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I was worried a=
nd nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on their presenc=
e. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.

all homams like Anugya, KalashaSuddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I guess A=

was pretty nervous about the possibility. Because long back in 2002-2003 wh=

erfection of pronunciation and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were so =
strong. But I didn't give up and tried to understand the correct ways becau=
se since I saw the power in it, I had to find what's the right way to get t=
he pure blessings, avoiding mistakes.

aJi] instructed to stay in an empty stomach while doing homam. I find this =
100% true from my mantra japam experience. Though no website or almost no o=
ne instructed me to stay empty stomached in japam, I found that mantras wor=
k very strong with empty stomach. Also, I always got strong negative effect=
s when I did japam after my dinner. Thus, I learned this from my own experi=
ence but after a lot of troubles faced [for the wrong practices I did]! Now=
 days, I can't eat anything after my lunch... because I do mantras in the e=
vening. At times it becomes very difficult not to eat something as I someti=
mes hang out with friends etc. at afternoon or early evening. But I have no=
 choice.
