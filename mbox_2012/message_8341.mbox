namaste to all,

I would like to add my few thoughts here. Sincerity & inte=
nsity of Intentions are 2 of the most valuable of attributes. If one is rea=
dy for certain level of Sadhana, one will get all the resources by supreme =
power. if one is ready for so called "Mahavidya Sadhana", one will be provi=
ded suitable resources for that. even real teacher will come at ones door-s=
tep to teach. To give an instcance, I know a friend who is doing Homa, Chan=
di paath and such Sadhana for few years. though he has devotion to form of =
Mother Goddess, he has no desire for Mahavidya sadhana and does not even do=
 casual search for any informnations on the internet. he knows that Mother =
will provde the intense desire and resources at the right time if at all th=
at Sadhana is needed.
really, for almost everybody, specifically for people=
 got in to family business, the only bhavana needs to be developed is to be=
come a child of Supreme Mother (Jagadamba or Rama or Krishna or Shiva or Bu=
dhha or Guru or Rishi or jesus or Allah or...) in present world.      
I ha=
ve highest admiration for Thakur Ramakrishna or Vimalananda because they bo=
th gave the Identical message which is the most important message of our ti=
me atleast-IMO. "Be a child in the lap of devine Mother" and then Mahavidya=
 or even post-Mahavidya will be provided, if needed.

Best Regards,

Utpal
