Perhaps because he knew he would be dying soon, Vimalananda sat me down one=
 day late in 1983 for what would be a final admonistion.
"Sooner or later, =
Robby, I am going to die"
=A0
"Yes, but you are not going to die any time s=
oon"
=A0
"Can you guarantee that?=A0Can you guarantee that you or I will be=
 alive even one minute from now?"
=A0
"I can't guarantee anything about me,=
 but i can gurantee that if you decide you want stay alive you can do it"
=
=A0
He continued without comment. "Everyone is going to die. Maybe now, may=
 be ,later; but someday I will=A0be gone and you will be left here. you hav=
e learned quite a lot and you have a lot left to learn. Never passup an opp=
ortunity to learn."
"Because it is kali yuga there are no longer any Rishi =
ashrams here=A0on the physical plane. But the Rishis are immortal=A0and the=
y can travel anywhere they like in the universe. This means that a Rishi mi=
ght be moving amongst us, in Bombay or anywhere else. of course no one woul=
d be able to recognize him; he would be in disguise. You would only be able=
 to recognize him if you knew the special signs on his body=A0 which distin=
guish him from ordinary human beings. Very few humans knows these signs"

"Whatever you are destined to have you will get, beyond=
 the shadow of a doubt. How and when you get it depend on how well you can =
cultivate your mind. The function of Tantra and Aghora is to put the govern=
ment of mind, senses and body into the proper order to avoid misery. Life m=
inus misery for a prolonged period produces satisfaction, which yields happ=
iness; and when happiness is increased beyond all concievable limits and is=
 sustained it becomes bliss, what the Vedas called Ananda. Sadhana is=A0a m=
eans to this end. When Kundalini awakens, if body, mind and spirit are in g=
ood working order bliss is certain.
=A0
Bliss is not something you have to =
create or accumulate; It arises spontaneously. Just let God decide what is =
best for you, and God will provide it accordingly. So even at those times w=
hen your will power is weak and your mental control is poor, there is still=
 nothing to worry about. Always, always remember that the supreme method of=
 mind control, the supreme intoxication, is the perpetual repetition of the=
 sweet name of God. Never forget God and God will never forget you. And one=
 day you will succeed"
