Namaste friends,
=A0
I want to share a parable related to self-realization,=
 heaven, religion, pseudo-wisdom, sadhana etc.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Bound in Maya:
=A0
There was a room (cosmos) th=
at was filled with really bright light (Self). It was filled with many peop=
le (beings in this cosmos), whose eyes had been closed (ego-sense or I-ness=
) for such a long time that opening them is not natural anymore and eyes fe=
el as though they simply can't be opened (dense conditioning)!
=A0
They wer=
e moving around like that, hitting and rubbing against each other, liking s=
ome and disliking some and becoming angry at some for hitting them.
=A0
*=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Self-Realization:
=A0
Th=
ere were some people at different times in different parts of the room, who=
 managed to open their eyes and see the brilliant light (Self-realized). On=
ce they could see, some looked for the doors, opened them and left the room=
 (videhamukti), while some stayed in the room and moved around (jeevanmukti=
). The light made them feel so nice and gave them such clarity. They clearl=
y saw everybody around them moving about and all of their misconceptions ab=
out what others were upto disappeared. They no longer harbored any ill-feel=
ings for someone hitting them. They continued to hit some people and be hit=
 by some people, but they could better understand what was happening, becau=
se they could see.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

Religions:
=A0
Some with opened eyes started giving guidance to others. Som=
e gave directions on how to go to less crowded and more pleasant parts of t=
he room (various heavens). Some gave directions on how to open the eyes (Se=
lf-realization).
=A0
Some people ignored the importance of opening *their o=
wn* eyes and instead developed fascination and admiration for those with op=
en eyes and started following them blindly. But they got lost while trying =
to follow, because they could not see. People started arguing about which w=
ay to go. Followers of the same open-eyed persons, after they left the room=
, kept arguing which way the persons who left wanted them to follow. Being =
unable to see, they were all wrong in different ways of course.
=A0
Instead=
 of trying to open their eyes, they kept running here and there with closed=
 eyes and arguing with others on where to go. Some spent a lot of energy an=
d time convincing others to walk along with them  (conversions) and felt pr=
oud of being part of big groups. Some called those who were going other way=
s and crossed their paths by bad names and even tried to hurt them or even =
kill them.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Pseudo-w=
isdom:
=A0
Some people recognized that various people may have seen the sam=
e light though their descriptions were in different words. They realized th=
at everyone will and can see that same light if they opened their eyes. The=
y correctly recognized the closed eyes (conditioned egosense or I-ness) as =
the problem.
=A0
But they grossly *underestimated* the difficulty in openin=
g eyes after keeping them closed for too long. They kept saying, "you just =
open your eyes and then there will be brilliant light". Some even *imagined=
* that their eyes were open and that they were seeing bright light.
=A0
*=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Sadhana:
=A0
Some recogn=
ized the role of effort in opening eyes. They kept trying to pull the eye l=
ids apart consciously everyday (sadhana). Some of them had such wild imagin=
ation and anticipation of what they would see when the eyes opened (experie=
nces), that they were carried away by that and could not focus the energy o=
n actually opening the eyes. Some of them ended up imagining that they were=
 seeing brilliant scenes that they had imagined earlier.
=A0
Some of them k=
ept arguing about how to wash the hands before trying to open eyelids and h=
ow to pull them, with what force, in what angle etc etc (specifics & proced=
ures). Instead of pulling eyelids apart however one can do it, they kept ar=
guing about the best way to do it and their eyes remained closed.
=A0
Some =
of them suceeded in opening the eyes a little bit and the flash of brillian=
t light startled them. Having been in darkness for too long, they could not=
 keep eyes open for more than a split second. They closed eyes again, but b=
ecame proud of their achievement. They assumed that the light could be seen=
 only for a split second by anyone and that they achieved what was there.
=
=A0
Of course, some of them did not complicate things, did not get distract=
ed and tried sincerely using the best method they could think of and manage=
d to open eyes and see light.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
