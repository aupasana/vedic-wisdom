Namaste,

There were so many sentences in that blog which could be picked=
, questioned, debated and ripped, and shredded that I am not even sure whet=
her to laugh or to cry.

This kind of dubious logic can be used to prove an=
ything under the sun. Moreover, the so called Navasati is a figment of some=
 "SRI SRI SRI KALYANANDA BHARATHI MANTACHARYA MAHASWAMY"'s meditations usin=
g 'mantra-shastra' to baptise the Saptasati to make it "vedic" (as per thei=
r understanding of what vedic must entail) and save it from "Tantrikas". So=
rry, sounds like a bag of hot air.


Many statements are rank malicious, li=
ke - "The term "PARAMPARA" invariably denotes=C2=A0 VEDIC PARAMPRA ONLY and=
 there is no PARAMPARA FOR SAPTHASATHI"! Absolute rubbish. Tantras are as m=
uch a valid path as any other. And there have been great paramaparas which =
have been using the Sri Sri Chandi as its main sadhana and producing lines =
of serious spiritual greats since ages. If anyone really has a far better l=
ocus standi to comment on Sri Sri Chandi, it is the Tantrika Paramparams, f=
or they have done this sadhana is far greater depth and dimension and volum=
e than anyone else at any point in history. Whatever one cannot digest is n=
ot necessarily bad and evil and flawed. As a corollary, this blog reminded =
me of the religious fights during middle-ages, when each group would kill t=
he other fighting over whose imaginary sky-daddy is greater.

I could have =
still attempted to take this so called found-in-meditation 'navasati' with =
some seriousness, had not the author of this blog betrayed such rank ignora=
nce, malice, bigotry and intolerance of what clearly has gone way above his=
 cranium. Moreover it is questionable if his so called Vedic-wisdom is trul=
y what the Vedas say, or something *he thinks* the Vedas are saying.

Anywa=
y. There is no debate here. At best, after completing the whole blog I have=
 only one question for the author, "Sir, what have you been smoking?".

Dear PVR Narsimha Garu/Or other great sadhakas in=
 the group,

I adore Saptashati and fond of reading/reciting/meditating on =
it.  I recently came across something called Navashati.  Some how it did no=
t feel right that some one was trying to find faults with Saptashati.

Here=
 is a link that I found

http://navasathi.blogspot.com/2011/11/sri-devi-mah=
atmyam-chandi-navasati.html

For me Saptashati feels complete, right and re=
sonates well. 

Please comment if you care to on this Navashati which was r=
aised by one. 

Regards,
Kris.
