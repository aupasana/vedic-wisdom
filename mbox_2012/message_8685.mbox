Hi,
=A0 =A0 I still cannot understand why it is wrong to have a spiritual e=
xperiences or to think about them. After all we cannot go to a shop and jus=
t buy them. If we are doing sadhana and we need support they are going to h=
appen. Why deny them? Suppose someone is doing the complete purscharan =A0o=
f mantra, is to wrong =A0not to expect something amazing might happen at th=
e end of it.

Some years ago there was a Hindi author who was well off and =
had a Temple in their home for several generations. Something happened in t=
his authors life and he felt lot of trauma and could not find mental peace.=
 In his later life he took up doing prayers and japa etc as he was taught i=
n his younger days. One night his daughter said to him, you are doing so mu=
ch prayers etc, have you had any experiences.

The author became upset and =
said, no, he had not any experiences. Many times he thinks that he is sitin=
g in front of a stone in the temple and it is all useless. But he will not =
give up his prayers as his time is coming nearer.
Next morning when this au=
thor was in his Temple and priest was doing ManglaAarti, The Deity
Spoke to=
 him and comforted him.

=A0Several days later when he went to a famous Tem=
ple in Rajasthan, again the Divine Lord spoke to him there and comforted hi=
m and said there is no difference between Him and Deities in his home Templ=
e.

When I read this story I knew immediately it was a true story. Very sim=
ilar things have happened with me to help me and comfort me.=A0

We are goi=
ng from A to B. Is it a relentless journey? Are there no breaks, petrol sta=
tions or shops where we can get out and stretch ourselves. Are there any ro=
ad signs. Spiritual experiences are like these. They guide us and show us i=
f we are on a right path.

I was thinking of writing to this devotee who ha=
d this powerful experience in Temple. Please write about it. What you exper=
ienced and what really happened. It will give knowledge to others. But then=
 I realised that I am a lone ranger here and many times go against the stre=
am.

=A0Many people are very young here and take NarasimhaBhai as their gur=
u or spiritual adviser. So if guruji is saying something, chela and clients=
 cannot go against it. Othewise their fire-pot, ghee-pot and coco-pot will =
be confiscated.=A0

I was also like this in my life. I took diksha=A0 from =
my Late Uncle who was famous in his days.
When I tried to talk to him about=
 Darshan of Divine Lord, he became very negative and said it is not possibl=
e. I kept very quite. I did not try to give examples of saints like Tulsida=
s or others who had Darshan. I had not done any spiritual sadhana and so no=
 personal experiences.
.=A0
Since then my life has changed due to different=
 spiritual experiences. Sure I am still in lot of pain and not in a complet=
e bliss all the the time but I know Divine Beings can very easily give Dars=
han And having spiritual experiences are very helpful for spiritual growth.=


Thanks
LaxmiNarayan
