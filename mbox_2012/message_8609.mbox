I completely, absolutely, 120% agree with this statement. People love t=
o preach and pontificate, and in all likelihood they have no *real* experie=
nce of what they are talking about and are indulging in, well, intellectual=
 <insert-the-verb-here>. All the genuine Saints that one has seen (and it c=
ould very likely be my own bias speaking here) would happily give up all th=
eir mystical experiences or spiritual progress if they felt that it would h=
elp their fellow humans - if you are truly realized, you *will* see Naaraay=
ana in everyone, then how can you not empathize with them???
