This message from Swamiji is for the year 2006, but the message is forever =
relevant. Hence I am presenting for reading of the fellow group members:

N=
ew Year Message from Poojya Swamiji Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya Guruku=
lam)

This is the beginning of a new year. We can start afresh. Whether it =
is the first of January, the
fourteenth of April, or any other time, it is =
important. We need such an event. We require to
have a day or an event that=
 we can call a beginning. The human being is always aspiring for a
better d=
ay, a better turn. He/she knows that what is here today may not be here tom=
orrow=97lay
offs are always a possibility. If our situation is pleasant and=
 comfortable, we want that situation
to continue. But if our situation is u=
npleasant or uncomfortable, we want a break. Let this new
year initiate a n=
ew turn, a new beginning. The hope is always there, but it has to be imbued=
 with
some prayers.

Hope is on what basis? There is no basis for hope! Onl=
y the human heart is hopeful. There is
no other basis. What is the basis? B=
etween the heartbeats "lub" and "dub," there is a gap. "Lub." Then, if you =
are allowed, "dub." You are alive now, so there is "lub." To let the "dub" =
come and then the "lub" come, there is grace. There is grace between the "l=
ub" and the "dub." There is something that keeps us going, and that is what=
 hope is all about. But then the basis for hope is only prayerfulness. If w=
e have a certain prayerful attitude, there is no reason why we can't hope f=
or a better turn. We must aspire for it, pray for it, and work for it.

One=
 important thing you must know: Even though we work for certain things that=
 we want to
accomplish, there is no guarantee that we will accomplish them.=
 It is clear that the effort we
make need not produce the result that we wa=
nt. While watching a baseball game, the batsman
swings the bat at the ball =
and then looks out yonder for the ball. The catcher behind him has it.

The=
re was no connection at all between the bat and the ball. If there is a con=
nection and the ball
keeps traveling, it need not be a home run. It could b=
e a foul ball. Then what is the use of that
connection? Or if it travels ou=
t to the field, a player out there may catch it. That player, in fact,
is p=
rayerful that he will catch it. And the batsman is prayerful that he will n=
ot catch it. That is
why the Lord is sometimes confused. Therefore, the Lor=
d occasionally obliges him and
occasionally obliges you. 

Now you can unde=
rstand why we sometimes win and sometimes lose. If we were always the winne=
r, our competitor would always be the loser. And if the competitor were alw=
ays the loser, there would be no fun in competition. Where is the competiti=
on if one loses all the time? Therefore, everything is okay. All is well.

=
Prayerfulness is a pervasive attitude, an attitude that governs our life, a=
n attitude that gives us an inner leisure whereby we can accommodate an unp=
leasant situation, if not pleasantly, we can atleast manage it. That inner =
leisure gives us the space that will enable us to face situations objective=
ly. And that space is provided by prayerfulness. Think of it. If we were no=
t prayerful,we would always think of ourselves as losers. But we are not lo=
sers because we are not the authors of the results of action.

We are the a=
uthors of our actions only, not the authors of the results of our actions (=
karma phalam)=97the situations that we face. Given this fact, the most appr=
opriate thing to do is to take
whatever result comes with an even attitude.=
 By not getting what we want, we become wiser. Not getting what we want doe=
s not mean we have become losers. We have a choice over our actions=97we ca=
n perform a given action, we need not perform it, or we can perform it
diff=
erently=97but over the results of our actions, we have no choice whatsoever=
. The author of the result of action is =EE=FAvara, the Lord. We can accept=
 that.

We have a choice to make an effort to the best of our ability, bank=
ing upon our know-how, the validity of our know-how, and the credibility of=
 our know-how. Banking upon that alone we
perform action. However, that kno=
w-how may not be adequate. We have to take into account all other factors, =
and many of those factors are unknown. We have no knowledge of the hidden v=
ariables, and without knowledge of those hidden variables, how can we alway=
s be a winner?
We cannot always be a winner! To control the hidden variable=
s, what can we do? We can do! We can pray.

Prayer is an action. Prayerfuln=
ess is an attitude. We can pray for a better turn and for the continuity of=
 what we have that is good. But prayer is not enough. We also need to be re=
sourceful. We need to be active. We need to do. Every Hindu mother does thi=
s. She is resourceful. She takes a bath in the morning and makes herself el=
igible for preparing food for the family. Only she won't say, "Food for the=
 family and food for =CE=FAvara, (naivedya)." She prepares the food all rig=
ht, for which she makes all the effort, and then the prepared food is offer=
ed to =CE=FAvara. Afterwards, the family eats the pras=E2da because =CE=FAv=
ara doesn't take away what is offered to Him. It is a great thing.

Suppose=
 you offered one hundred and eight modakams to Ġane=FAa and He stretch=
ed out His trunk and took all one hundred and eight. You would be talking a=
bout it for three days. Then, suppose you offered modakams again the next d=
ay and He took them away, and also the third day's offering He took away. T=
hen you will ask for Ġane=FAa 's help=97"You please help. How can I ma=
ke one hundred and eight modakams every day?" But Ġane=FAa doesn't tak=
e it away. Do you know why Ġane=FAa doesn't take away whatever you off=
er Him on the plate? Since Ġane=FAa is over here, over there, and ever=
ywhere=97He is all pervasive (sarva vy=E2p=EE])=97He wouldn't know where to=
 keep it! So He leaves it there on the plate itself. He takes only your att=
itude (bh=E2vana). Parokṣa priy=E2ḥ sarve devaḥ . It is b=
eautiful! We all understand this very well. Therefore, we make an offering =
to the Lord, and then we take it back as pras=E2da.

We need to do. Doing i=
s never discounted. We plan and we do. However, even if we plan and do our =
homework properly, we can still miss out on what we want to achieve. There =
are a lot of slips between the cup and the lips. Also there are a lot of sl=
ips between the plate and the mouth and the mouth and the stomach. The food=
 we eat may not go to the stomach; it may go into our windpipe instead. Peo=
ple die because of that. They go to yama loka. This is not easy. When that =
is so, we had better earn some of Bhagav=E2n's grace.

Prayerfulness is not=
 enough. We need to be active. We need to be pragmatic. And prayer is part =
of our pragmatism. What is pragmatism? When we objectively and dispassionat=
ely take into account all the factors and hidden variables that are there a=
nd then plan and do, that is pragmatism. What can we do to control the hidd=
en variables? Pray! Prayer is an action. It is religious pragmatism. That i=
s the vaidika. The vaidika is religiously pragmatic. 

All of us assembling=
 here in this hall before the Lord to begin this first day of the new year =
is religious pragmatism. It is perfect! We could not begin it better. We be=
gin with a prayer. On New Year's Eve many people get lost. But at least on =
the first day of the new year, we begin with a prayer so that we won't get =
lost. Prayer is an action, and it has a result. The result is grace. We use=
 the word "grace" for want of a better word. But, really speaking, the resu=
lt of prayer is grace. It is punya.

Punya alone accounts for what we call =
luck. And we earn that punya. We earn that luck. It is not that luck is som=
e chance. We pile up punya so that we will neutralize all the causes for ba=
d luck. The causes for bad luck are called durita. So durita kṣay=E2r=
tham is the sankalpa the priests will make before beginning the p=FBja =97"=
To neutralize the causes that bring about unpleasant situations and to enha=
nce the causes that bring about pleasant situations, I perform
this ritual,=
 this prayer." So with the Lord's/ =CE=FAvara's/ Dakṣin=E2m=FBrti's g=
race, may this new year, 2006, bring us what we want day after day and help=
 us avoid what we don't want. We need both. We need to avoid what we don't =
want; we need to achieve what we want; and what we have that is good we nee=
d to retain (yoga kṣema). We pray for yoga kṣema. Happy New Yea=
r to everybody!
