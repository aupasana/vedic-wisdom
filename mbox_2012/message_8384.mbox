and you think you can escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Are you =

his mind plunged into chaos and darkness. Like in a state of debilitating t=
rance, he got up from the floor and sat down. The Bhairavi was not there in=
 the room. He looked all around him. Then he saw her on the road outside, w=
alking towards the ganges. He cried out to her, "Don't leave me here, I mus=
t know who you are. I am confused about life and everything else". As soon =
as he uttered these words, the room started reverberating with a attahasa, =
though there was not a soul present there apart from him. A laughter so lou=
d that he left his ear drums will split. He rushed out into the rain to fol=
low the moving figure of the Bhairavi. The faster he ran, the more did the =
distance keep increasing between him and the Bhairavi. Then he could see cl=
early, the Bhairavi entering into the Ganges water, and kept moving deeper =
until she was drowned completely in the water. The author sat near the bank=

 night with not a soul in the open.

 years back here in London I was coming home in the afternoon. I was in a c=

 to meditate on Her in that crowded bus. I even smiled myself on the strang=
eness of that situation. After few more minutes I reached home and opened m=
y front door and went inside. After going through my Puja room and telling =
my mother that I was back, I flopped on sofa in front room which is very ne=
ar to front gate. Then I heard some noises but I did not get up and slept f=
or nearly one hour. After I got up I got a srrong feeling to open my front =
door although nobody had knocked. The whole area in front of my house was c=
overed in Police lines and tapes. I could not believe it.

 day I was clearly saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner=
 sky several minutes before the incident and I started Her prayers although=
 there was no reasons for me to do so. Then I slept whole time without know=
