Dear All,
 
* Insert Awkward long silence here *

"Ahem"
Oh yaar bhen ma=
rrayen yeh sab saari sadhnayeen, tum log bhagwaan pe kyun nahin focus karte=
 ho, aaltoo faltoo dhakke khane ki bajaiye,

Kisi ko bhagwaan se toh pyaar =
hai nahin, bas siddhi chahiyen inko, yeh saadhna karni hai, woh saadhna kar=
ni hai, karna kuch hai nahin, bas bolna hai, apne mann ki tasalli karne ke =
liye.

First develop true love for god, then you need not ask what will thi=
s bring and what will that bring, what karmas, what siddhis, what superpowe=
rs, what anything.

No amount of pdf's, books, reading material will take y=
ou to god, till god turns into your beloved and no sacrifice on your end is=
 too extreme to catch a glimpse of your beloved.

Everybody on this board (=
excluding a few) wants "experiences", i Have seldom come across anyone who =
wants god.

You people want proper procedures on doing reading  stotra, rea=
ding 10 different stotras, doing worship for "different" deities, which dir=
ection should the idol be in, this , that , its too much noise.
Worship god=
 as an ignorant child ,a lover lost in love, then you will automatically kn=
ow what to do.

Tumhen bhagwan chahiye, ya experiences???
 Everybody is aft=
er the results of a homam, kyun bhai business deal chal rahi yahan pe, yah =
pooja??

Yeh blog waali sadhna tum tab karna ya karmon ka hisaab lagana jab=
 tumhen pehle bhagwaan se sacha pyaar ho, jab sacha pyaar hoga, toh "tum" t=
oh beech mein hoge nahin, sadhana bhi siddh, minimal karmas, plus connectio=
n with god will come then.

Fools approach these practices for "experiences=
", "powers", and get stuck there.

First have the love to play this to your=
 chosen form of your wroship

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DzkbaRP8xtLI
=

And for saadhnas like those mentioned in that blog, try playing the song f=
or beings who appear "fierce", for beings whom "you" are ready to die for, =
for a form of god that you will go all out for.

Once there was a man in Gu=
jrat, who hankered on and on and on how will do anything for god, one night=
 in a cremation ground  he was given an axe, a bottle of whiskey ( to get D=
runk), and was told , Cut your arm off for god, you said you will do anythi=
ng right??? Plus you are not the body this the dialogue you have been givin=
g to everyone, now stay true to your words.

Bete, jo saadhnaayen sab ko it=
na lubhati hain na, woh tumhe acchi tarah se test bhi karti hain. A "right"=
 person as mentioned by Rajarshi equates to a person first in love with god=
, then toh you can walk on this path, otherwise instead of going up, you wi=
ll crash and burn for millions of existences, till a higher being takes pit=
y on you.

Isliye chuck all this and focus on doing as much worship as poss=
ible in this birth, chant as much as you can, as many homams, as much celib=
acy.

If any of these sadhnas are in your destiny, don't worry god will ope=
n doors, automatically, till then worship, worship with love.

Do a homam t=
o celebrate god, not to do a business deal subconsciously EVER.  

Khair ch=
horo, whom am I, it was not directed at you priyank, never take it as that,=
 aaj scotch thori kam rah gayi saali, isliye gusaa aa raha tha, bare dino s=
e socha ki kuch type karen, aaj mauka mila.

Bhagwan ko pyaar karne ke liye=
 pooja karo, wohi siddh hai baki sab bakwaas hai

Bhagwaan se pyaar karo ja=
ise baaki larke larkiyon se karte ho, sachcha pyar jisme jaan bhi jaaye toh=
 kya gum hai, hamara mehboob khush hona chahiye. Jab yeh aajaaye phir vam m=
arga pe chalo toh 3 second mein assamn mein ur jaaoge, nahin toh kabar khud=
 jaayegi..

Left can't ever exist without the right. Right is imperative, n=
ot for safety, but its too much filled with love. For the one who can actua=
lly love god, there are no heights high enough. 

Chant any name of god as =
much as you can. Once god becomes your beloved, then you'll be telling this=
 to others. You will not care for puraan's, reading materials, religious te=
xts, you won't have time to think, you'll be lost, and combine that with a =
ritual like a homam =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D ( Equals to ) =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D
This song will be playing in the background once that combinat=
ion is achieved

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DFbO9RUMTfvA

Everything w=
ill automatically make sense to you, all the texts, all the stuff.

Khair, =
anyways, repeat the sweet sweet name of god, leave aside all these karmic c=
alculations and everything else. Once we are with god god will automaticall=
y teach "you".

Mind the ""'s

Jai Shri Radheya!!

Nobody
