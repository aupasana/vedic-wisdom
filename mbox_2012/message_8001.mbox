Sir

You are taking an miniscule proportion of the donation rejection cases=
 and claiming that donation does not work. These are the statistics below f=
or eye donations done successfully yearly in India.

I am quoting directly =
from Indian express.

http://www.indianexpress.com/news/a-lot-needs-to-be-d=
one-to-create-awareness-on-eye-donation/551681/0

1. 1/3rd of the world's b=
lind population is in India and most of them go blind due to preventable ca=
taract formation and other issues.

2.Sankara Netrayala as mentioned in the=
 article is an acclaimed organization which on a average conducts on a aver=
age 1000 eye transplantation surgeries.

1000!!!! lives impacted with one o=
rganization...is that an small number. Still millions wait for an surgery t=
o gain eyesight. 


By the way ..Sankara Netrayala is associated with the K=
anchi peetham and was inspired by the clarion call of Sri Jayendra Saraswat=
hi in the 1970's. Also the Kanchi peetham has an annex centre associated wi=
th Sankara Netralaya. 

Kanchi peetham also works with the Sankara eye foun=
dation

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankara_Nethralaya

http://www.sankara=
nethralaya.org/patient-care-jkcn.html

Nobody is advocating not following t=
he samskaras after death.What is preventing the following of the samskara f=
or rest of the corpse.

Which is an greater punya , using an part of the bo=
dy after the soul has left to bring alive the life of another person or bli=
ndly sticking to dogma.

Regards
Vemparla RamKishore
