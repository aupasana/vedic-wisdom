First of all, thanks to all of you, many many times for taking time to ad=
dress my issue. You have no idea how much support morally you guys have pro=
vided me. Now coming to the suggestion that were given, i will list them do=
wn here and mention which ones i am already following and which i am not:
B=
rahmacharya: Yes, for the past several years (almost 5 yrs), i am into brah=
macharya. Although i am a house hold leading family life, i am into Brahmac=
harya as i chose to live like that. According to me, sex is only for reprod=
uction. After, i got two children, i took the practise.
Humility: Yes, alwa=
ys humiliated, whenever i get abusive thoughts, i do situps, stand infront =
of god and ask for forgiveness.
Reciting stotras: I recite lalitha, lakshmi=
, sri suktham, lakshmi japam, Vishnu sahasra namam and listen to Rudram reg=
ularily.
Reciting stotras with open eyes instead of closed eyes: Yes, i do =
the same as closed eyes make me suffer more.
Chandi kavacha: No, i am not r=
eciting this. I shall start. Do i have to follow any special niyama's? othe=
r than purifying my body.
Disciplined life style: I will become more discip=
lined hence forth.
Pranayamam: No, i shall do this one as well
EFT on inter=
net: No, but not sure what does it stand for. Can u pls elaborate so that i=
 can google accordingly.
Charity: Yes i am a little bit into it, but will e=
xpand more
Now, what i understandd the main  cause for my situation is a ve=
ry STRONG mind and weak senses. My mind records any evil things, that i see=
, hear very very strongly, that it keeps on repeating those in such away th=
at, evil thoughts become a part of my thought process. As such, i am carryi=
ng those with me all the time and what ever i do, they get pronounced. In o=
ther cases, i may not care much, but as far as GOD, i know its sin, so my m=
ind is sending some alarms as well parallely.In short, i completely failed =
to control my mind. By the time i realized what it is turning me into, it t=
ook me completely.
i also have this obsession of over cleanliness when it c=
omes to god. i can't offer prayers without head bath. i maintian a strict d=
ress code like old age Brahmins have, "madi" and dont touch anythign at hom=
e when i am doing pooja. i can't tolerate indscipline when it comes to god.=
 
Lately, i have started homams. i am not doing them , but going to temple =
and having priest perform them. When ever i do homam, i am getting some rel=
ief. I thank you one and all for your time. I shall follow your guidelines =
and keep u all posted on my progress. I need that support so that i can con=
tinue my devotional journey without the afraid of getting a "sinner" tag.
B=
est Regards and heartful pranamams,
Challa

Hello,

veral years ago, I was suffering from similar sort of things and may be muc=

learned dif=

=C2=A0 
What I wi=
ll suggest that you should check out EFT on internet. It is a extremely pot=
ent method of self healing and growth and protection. There are several gro=
ups which are offering solutions to different problems using EFT. 
on you t=
ube etc. Although it is always a very good thing if there is a caring famil=
y member or friend to give support but many times we have to=C2=A0make cert=
ain effort ourselves. In learning EFT on internet you do not have to pay a =
single penny. 
=C2=A0 
If it is possible depending on your physical health =
do body detox every 2/3 months to clean out inner system. 
I can write cert=
ain other methods but it might make you more confused and I certainly do no=
t want it. 
=C2=A0 
What ever you decide , Do not leave your everyday praye=

Thanks

ave me! Help needed.

Respected NARASIMHA ji and other learned scholar,

I =
am posting my condition with a hope of getting some
 relief and solution. K=
indly do not judge me based on my condition, rather give me some positive s=
olution and perspective to what I am going through.

I am a very strong bel=
oved of god and a very strong devotee. I love to worship him as much as I c=
an.however, all my passion, interest seems to get drained and discouraged d=
ue to my mindset and the hell I go through because of it. I always , always=
 get negative & abusive thoughts and tie those to the god. For ex, if I hea=
r a foul language, see a negative thing, bad or foul my mind relates or tie=
s it to god. My mind start abusing god with the same foul language.
When I =
do Japam, =C2=A0my mind would not get concentration, but goes into this evi=
l mode with racing thoughts.
I can't see directly into the eyes of god with=
 the fear of my mind abusing him I can't focus my drishti on god statues. M=
y thoughts are extremely foul...most specially foul language. However, I ba=
ttle my thoughts with my worship, which means I don't give up praying him. =
I requested him several times to relive me from such pain so that I can inc=
rease my devotion and prayers. I love him. I want to pray him.=C2=A0
Curren=
tly, my mind and it's racing evil & foul thoughts have become a road block =
in my devotion and trying to keep me away from him as much as possible. At =
one point of time, they dominated me and I had to stay away from praying hi=
m for a while.

Now my questions are
Am I a Maha papi or ghora papi that th=
is is happening to me?
Why does it happen to me?
Is it some kind of disorde=
r
Am in incurring wrath of god=C2=A0
I am scared to death that I am accumul=
ating the greatest sin enough for some 100 births
What
 can I do to get out=
 of this perversion and be able to concentrate on him
I want to worship god=
 like every one does
I am highly stressed because of this constant battle. =
My forehead area, jaws are always in pain because of this stress.

Please h=
elp me , but do no hate me. Please do not disregard or discard my email. Th=
is is a situation I can't disclose to anyone in person with the fear of hat=
red and resentment. I am hoping to get some relief from learned scholars li=
ke yourself.
