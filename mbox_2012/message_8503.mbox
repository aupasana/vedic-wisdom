Hello,
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Thanks for writing this mail for =
me.

=C2=A0In 1999 a Light had appeared in my Puja Room for several minutes=
 and then I had very unexpectedly chance to visit Sri Nathdwara for several=
 days which was a very happy experience.

I have a very difficult physical =
pain and despite having several times extraordinary spiritual experiences, =
it has not been resolved. Yesterday was one of those days and i was very up=
set due to pain. About midnight I was saying to Divine Lord who reside in N=
athdwara that You do not care and similar things. Then I went to bed withou=
t eating.
In the morning when I saw your letter I felt Divine Lord looking =
at me.

That window is there so that Divine Lord could look at His devotees=
 with Loving gaze, who live in far away lands and needs His Grace all the t=
ime.

Thanks again for writing this timely letter.
LaxmiNarayan

=C2=A0 
Hello,

had visited this tem=
ple a few years ago.

The have kept a windows (Small One) on the far away w=
all of the temple right opposite the Diety Shreenath ji, so that as per a p=
romise made to Dhruva- it could have a Darshan of the Diety Shreenath ji as=
 soon as the Darshan opened in the morning.

This window they say is the wi=
ndow for Darshans of Shreenathji for Dhruva who was His Ardent devotee. Now=
 if the Stars were moving why would they have placed this wondow as such. I=
 am wondering, because the temple Creators are much more smarter than all t=
he Panchang makers collectively assembled together .

Some one please answe=
r this one.

regards,
Bhaskar.
