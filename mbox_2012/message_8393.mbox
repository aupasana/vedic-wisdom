Dear Shrikanth,

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 You menti=
oned about huge punyas from 'past lives' when you wrote about Ramakrishna. =
But let me please say, these kind of concepts like karma, punya etc don't a=
pply to Him. When the Cosmic Order wants some things done and a soul like R=
amakrishna appears, a specific set of karmas are given in order to sustain =
that life until the duty is over. It then dissolves way from the material p=
lane.

Narasimhaji and Rajasrshiji hit it on the right spot.

I got into a we=
e bit of sadhana due to a personal issue and My personal experience with Ma=
ha Vidya sadhana has been very strenuous and emotionally tiring(Had some sm=
all experiences of Maa though they could not be verified by a Guru) and is =
not for everyone. We need to have done some very good karmas in the past to=
 come into the corridors of Devi. This is said in all puranas and upapurana=
s however to sustain our focus is very difficult unless we have a very comp=
etent Guru. I have spent close to 6 years searching for a true tantrik prac=
titioner and i found one very sincere amercian student who is named as Shri=
 Ugranand Saraswathi.=C2=A0 All that is available on the internet is just t=
o cheat gullible masses. A greatest master like Ramakrishna took 12 years o=
f intense sadhana to get her darshan with huge punya from his past lives. T=
here is no doubt about it.

Unfortunate part is that you will ofcourse have=
 some experiences out of this sadhana as it is very powerful but we would n=
ot know if it was a mind trip or hallucination or true divine presence. Ple=
ase note that you are not dealing some one in the hierarchy but the MAHAMAY=
A who can encompass even the trimurti to maya. We need immense blessings of=
 GaneshJi and Lord Shiva to progress on this path as small time energies wi=
ll not allow you to progress in sadhana.

My advice is not to leave HER FEE=
T come what may.

I remember a parable of Shri RK who says" As long as chil=
d is playing with toys of the world, she wont come to us, only when we cry =
for enlightenment does she come over leaving everything for us".
