Namaste.

>> I hope the meaning goes delivered.....

Not sure why you wrote=
 that, but truly I missed what you are trying to say :-)
 Are you saying bo=
th the homam and recital are too early for the kid ! Or so long as she foll=
ows the rules she is good doing both ?

Also, are you comparing homam or re=
cital to a fighter plane that has to be handled carefully ?
