Dear Rajarshi,

I had to re-read this a few times, but I think I'm finally =
understanding
what you are trying to convey. Thanks for explaining.

As Nar=
asimha mentioned, moksha and bandha are irrevocably linked. The
'status' of=
 the world is right in the middle of the two. We are all looking
at this fr=
om different points of view, based on our own conditioning.

I can't pull m=
yself out of the dream analogy. All of us dream. We are
creators of the dre=
am world, and it is our consciousness alone that forms
the material for the=
 dream world. Once created, a portion of ourselves gets
projected into the =
dream world, and we become subject to our own maya. We
interact with so man=
y other created beings, and interact based on the rules
of this dream world=
. Inside the dream world, for the duration of it's
existence, everything ap=
pears true.

The world that is created is based on the thoughts that went t=
hrough our
mind at the moment we fell into deep sleep. At some point, once =
we have
experienced enough, we naturally wake up. We spend some time in the=
 "real
world", and then the cycle repeats.

Our experiences inside our crea=
ted dream world have an impact on us when we
wake up. From time to time, we=
 remember our dreams and reflect on them. The
experiences certainly carry o=
n into our waking state to some extent, and
then back into the next dream e=
xperience.

By looking at every question from three points of time, we get =
three
different answers. The dream world is real for it's duration, unreal
=
between cycles and is conditionally real when looking across cycles.
Freedo=
m is interacting with the world with no attachment from inside the
world; r=
ealizing the absolute unreality of the world from outside; and is
both of t=
hese when looking across cycles.

>From all points of view, the thinning of =
the accumulated conditioning
(vAsanA-tAnavam) is the key.

sasneham,

   aj=
it

Dear Rajarshi,<div><br></div><div>I had to re-read this a few times, but I =
think I'm finally understanding what you are trying to convey. Thanks f=
or explaining.=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As Narasimha mentioned, moksha a=
nd bandha are irrevocably linked. The 'status' of the world is righ=
t in the middle of the two. We are all looking at this from different point=
s of view, based on our own conditioning.</div>

<div><br></div><div>I can&=
#39;t pull myself out of the dream analogy. All of us dream. We are creator=
s of the dream world, and it is our consciousness alone that forms the mate=
rial for the dream world. Once created, a portion of ourselves gets project=
ed into the dream world, and we become subject to our own maya. We interact=
 with so many other created beings, and interact based on the rules of this=
 dream world. Inside the dream world, for the duration of it's existenc=
e, everything appears true.=A0</div>

<div><br></div><div>The world that is=
 created is based on the thoughts that went through our mind at the moment =
we fell into deep sleep. At some point, once we have experienced enough, we=
 naturally wake up. We spend some time in the "real world", and t=
hen the cycle repeats.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Our experiences inside ou=
r created dream world have an impact on us when we wake up. From time to ti=
me, we remember our dreams and reflect on them. The experiences certainly c=
arry on into our waking state to some extent, and then back into the next d=
ream experience.</div>

<div><br></div><div>By looking at every question fr=
om three points of time, we get three different answers.=A0The dream world =
is real for it's duration, unreal between cycles and is conditionally r=
eal when looking across cycles. Freedom is interacting with the world with =
no attachment from inside the world; realizing the absolute unreality of th=
e world from outside; and is both of these when looking across cycles.</div=
>

<div><br></div><div>From all points of view, the thinning of the accumul=
ated conditioning (vAsanA-tAnavam) is the key.</div><div><br></div><div>sas=

<br>Everything, from the phys=

 Maya is nothing more than whatever obstructs an individual's mind from=

ve, the point of maximum stillness is the Purusha, what is called atmah/sou=
l, and everything else, from points of lesser stillness to the external obj=
ective reality is Shakti. Extending this principle to the Universe, the pur=
ely transcendental non-changing, non-negotiable reality can be called the &=
quot;atmah" while everything else, semi-transcendental to the objectiv=
e
 reality all around is Shakti. Thus in short, using scriptural terms, Nir=
guna Brahman is the state of mind of God, while the Universe(s)/various rea=
lm(s) is the body of God. Both are irrevocable linked for all practical pur=
poses.=A0 Maya is whatever inhibits an individual cell (a human being or an=

, God means infinity. Now what is infinity? It cannot be described, it cann=
ot be named, it cannot be understood using the five sense organs. Science d=
oes not understand infinity, art
 does not understand infinity, nothing or =
nobody=A0 understands infinity. It is a summation of all that we know, all =
that we can=A0 imagine and all that is impossible for us to imagine. It is =
an incomprehensible force that runs through everything, from the most lovea=
ble to the most despicable , from the most holy to the most unholy, from th=

 everything, and I mean EVERYTHING from livi=
ng to non-living, as a manifestation of that force and thus learn to love t=
he same unconditionally without expecting anything in return. No wonder suc=
h unconditional love is not easy. It needs tremendous effort to change our =
own conditioning of the mind, and work on our inherent biases and prejudice=
s. That is what the=A0 aim of sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself, t=
o make one ready to be able to unconditionally love everything. The greater=
 number of entities one can love unconditionally, that much little bit clos=
er one can come to interacting with the truly infinite. And those few rare =
human beings who can love a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly th=
e closest to this supreme and unknowable force. In common language, we call=
 them Rishis. </font></div>
