Dear          aparnaji - namaste

What you had done once can / should bec=
ome a daily practice. 

In our scriptures lot of rules and regulations are =
given which are primarily subjective and not objective. According to desha,=
 kala and sthiti these are bound to change / have transformation. So do not=
 hesitate to have this in your daily routine. You can utilize your precious=
 time in this way.

I'll suggest one more step for the ease of your homam. =
You might have seen rudrabhishek ritual in shiva temples. On the same line =
purchase one tripod, one small half circular pot [ =E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=B2=E0=A5=
=87=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=80, =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=AD=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B7=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=
=95=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 etc. ] with a small hole a=
t the bottom and an appropriate home kunda. Adjust position of tripod, circ=
ular pot w.r.t. centre of fire and half fill this pot with ghee, [=E0=A4=86=
=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF ] or=C2=A0 [=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=
=A4=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B2] seasem oil. This havan dravya in liquid form will st=
art following in the centre of fire drop by drop and at the same time you c=
an recite your mantra. Do not bother for touch with homedravya every time w=
hile reciting mantra, speed w.r.t. drop of ghee e.etc. Some time more drops=
 will follow or some time more mantras will be recited. But most imp is you=
r involvement in mantra chanting with least distraction and you will not be=
 bothered for offering aahuti every time while doing other house hold work.=


I know this is some what break away from ancient practice, rules etc but =
in=C2=A0 current world scenario doing sincere sadhana is imp. There might b=
e a some objections=C2=A0 on this practice but try this and you will find m=
ore peace, ease of doing home in such a way.

Regards

      Dear all,



I'm afraid I have a very stupid question. Is it okay to=
 do homam while standing up? 



I once did a very simple homam while cooki=
ng. While the food cooked for 20-30 minutes, I muttered the mantras and ten=
ded to a small homam kunda (basically a brass bowl, with some wooden sticks=
 and ghee and basil leaf offerings) that I placed on the table next to the =
cooking food. 



It was a very pleasant experience. Far from feeling distr=
acted, the simplicity of the whole process made it easier for me to focus o=
n the mantra. 



The key thing is I could do this sort of a homam every da=
y, as I cook most days. And my family would not complain that I am spending=
 too much time away from them doing spiritual things. (It might even give t=
he food a better flavour as people say that food cooked while repeating man=
tras with feeling absorbs the mantra...who knows!)



I am thinking of doin=
g an ultra simple homam while standing in the kitchen. Please tell me if yo=
u think this is against the scriptures, as I wouldn't want to do it if so.
=



I know people say feeling is more important that ritual. This homam proc=
edure gives me a pretty good feeling. I'm planning to give it a try again a=
nd see how it feels. I was wondering if there is anything in the scriptures=
 that forbids doing homam standing up? If I can generate concentration and =
feeling while standing and doing the homam, surely it will be equally effec=
tive (I hope so anyway). 



Thanks very much in advance. Sorry if it sound=
s silly! 



Aparna



P.S. I am doing a weekly homam the 'proper' way i.e.=
 sitting down and focussing. Just wanted to do a daily one and this would b=
e the best way for me right now. I have read the Agnihotra homam can be don=
e "anywhere" so wondering about other homams.
