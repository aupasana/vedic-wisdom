Namaste Vinayak ji,

You are welcome. One more obvious advantage of SK, is=
 you can practive
anywhere. During 2005 to 2011, my job used require me tra=
vel quite
often, so it was easier for me to continue my practice in hotel r=
oom in
any country, which would have been impossible with Homam.

All to be=
st with your spiritaul quest. Do share you experience and
finding.

Regarad=
s.

However, if one likes chapati and curr=
