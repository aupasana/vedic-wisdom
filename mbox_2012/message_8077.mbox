Hello Ji,

I have some similar experiences about fire etc., so I can share =
my opinion with you. Learned members can answer you the rest with their kno=
wledge and experience. Please look for my replies below, started with "TC" =
-

>>>> My dilemma. I struggle to keep the fire burning by adding dried coc=
onut pieces, drops of ghee, other such material while I recite the various =
mantras prescribed in the manual. But it bothers me that my attention is on=
 maintaining the fire when I should be concentrating on the mantras (I try =
to guess the real meaning behind the words in the mantra, I understand some=
 intuitively, some not at all, I take the whole by faith). At times when th=
e fire goes out I feel very bad. <<<<

TC: It happened with me also. The ma=
ngo-wood and jute sticks were burning out very very rapidly and I was very =
worried to maintain the fire and could not concentrate fully on the mantras=
.

TC: Seeing the video of Narasimha Ji I felt that coconuts must burn slow=
er and it should relieve you from the worries related to maintaining the fi=
re. I don't know why your coconuts are also burning out fast. I can give yo=
u my opinion after I do it with coconuts.

>>>> Espeically towards the end,=
 when i start to meditate, if I have to worry about the fire dying out, I f=
eel miserable because this is the most important part of the homam, accordi=
ng to the manual (well, Mr Narasimha). <<<<

TC: Same problem I faced also.=


>>>> I also notice that at times the drops of ghee falling on a small fir=
e actually put it off! So I have started to add the drops to the side of th=
e burning flame, may be on a piece of coconut. I make the ghee at home, so =
I do not suspect the quality of the ghee:-))<<<<

TC: Same happened to me a=
lso. But let me tell you something. When I was putting ghee on the mango wo=
od, some ghee was immediately absorbed by the wood and the wood was getting=
 wet and fire was going off from that wet part of the wood. It was making m=
e very worried. However later I found out that even though the wood was get=
ting wet and the fire was going off, soon the wet part was becoming hot wit=
h the fire again and thus fire was coming back there. So may be what you sh=
ould do is to be a little patient while fire goes off from one part (and le=
t OTHER AREA burn)... and wait a few second to see if the fire comes back i=
n the wet part of the wood again, as the wet part becomes hot also. This sh=
ould work. This worked for me.

TC: As I have observed, ghee is like oil or=
 something and it burns ITSELF. Thus if your coconut piece is burnt almost =
to ash, you still add ghee ahutis over that "almost ash coconut" or "almost=
 ash wood" and still the fire is burnt through the ghee drops, because ghee=
 itself is burning, though under the ghee there is almost nothing to burn b=
ecause the coconut is almost ash... but since ghee itself is burning, it is=
 not a problem.

TC: I guess this is why Narasimha Ji and other experienced=
 persons can do homam with a relatively small amount of coconut.

Learned m=
embers can correct me if I am wrong.

Yours,
Tanvir.
