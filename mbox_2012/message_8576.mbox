Happy Janam Ashtmi to All.

when sole objective is realisation how rule ca=
n apply,

did Rama see How Shabri offered "ber"

Lord Rama accepted Hanuman=
 ji (and Nishad who was from low cast ) though vanars are supposed to be in=
ferior

Lord Krishana gave Moksha to Kubja. and many others

Just when one =
surrenders completely to him and immerse himself IN HIM (Lord). no rule app=
lies.

Lord Krishan says 

"Leave all religions and completely surrender un=
to me. 
Then it is my responsibility O' Arjun to see you through."

   when=
 one does bhakti with rules means his attention is diverted to some other o=
bject.Just accept HIM as ur guide who is inside.

Uski  diwangi mein doob k=
e dekho.He will take ur  Yog kshem.

He needs " ananya bhakti.

even if if =
somebody sees inside body physically we r machine of many wastes and also w=
e have collected many waste at mental level.

Still Lord accepts us though =
we r no use of to HIM

regards

asically, is it acceptable for women to take part in external rituals durin=
g their menstrual cycle? Is it strictly ruled out or acceptable for some ri=
tuals and unacceptable for some specific ones? What about internal meditati=
on and naama japa? What about sitting and watching someone doing a ritual? =
What about watching homam? Does it depend on deity? Also, some people have =
long cycles where they see some blood drops for many days. Should they take=
 that entire period or the first n days (say, 5)?
