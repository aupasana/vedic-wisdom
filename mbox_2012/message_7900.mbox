Respected Sirs,
Namasthe,
To my knowledge, i understand that, as per our sc=
riptures=C2=A0one (grihasta)=C2=A0 should take=C2=A0yhe food after serving =
the needy (Athithi). So one should wait for the arrival of guest before tak=
ing food & if non arrives the grihastha can have his foodafter noon. The fo=
od that remains can be given to cows. As these r not possible in the presen=
t days, how can we fulfill the requirements of the shastras may kindly b ad=
vised.
With pranams,
Suryanarayanan.M

Namaste Sir,

Thank you for the reply. 

Your message =
reminded of story of Saint Tiruvalluvar. He used to place a toothpick and a=
 bowl of water while eating. Whenver a grain of rice fell, he used to pick =
it up with the toothpick rinse it in water and eat it thereafter.
