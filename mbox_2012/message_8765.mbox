Hi
Sri Narasimha ji has already written in the manuals.
"Misconception: Bef=
ore doing homam with any mantra, one must do japam of that mantra by a coun=
t that is ten times the homam count. For example, one must do japam by a co=
unt of 10,000 before one does homam by a count of 1,000.
Comment: This conv=
ention is not without reason. The true meaning of this convention is that h=
omam is ten times more powerful than japam. If one does a mantra 1,000 in a=
 homam, it is equivalent to doing the mantra 10,000 in japam. If one wants,=
 one can offer the mantra entirely in external fire and there is no need to=
 do any japam before doing homam.
All thumb rules and conventions have exce=
ptions. If a rishi with a very strong bhootaagni does japam, it is equivale=
nt to a homam and the "ten times" rule does not apply. However, for most no=
rmal people, homam is ten times more powerful than japam. The bottomline is=
 that the strength and the purity of the medium that accommodates the prese=
nce of the deity who receives the mantra will decide the effectiveness of t=
he mantra."
I personally feel that the rules and regulations present in Hin=
duism will only deter many seekers.Fear is already a big part in our life.

PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that i=
s for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualifie=
