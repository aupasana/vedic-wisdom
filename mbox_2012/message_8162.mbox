Sir,
Please provide Satya Narayana homa procedure.  I have downloaded all =

      Namaste Vasuji, You sent =
me this mail privately also. I was going to reply by cc'ing to the list ano=
nymously, but was busy. 1. You can start with Ganapathi homam. 2. Well, the=
n visualize Ganapathi as the beloved little child of your Devi Ma, who will=
 take you to Devi Ma, and not as the all-pervading essence. 3. Homam done a=
t such times is more useful, because it can reduce any unwanted karmic burd=
en that may be being carried by the soul in womb. Good luck and hope you ge=
t a blessed child. In fact, some of the good vasanas of the soul in womb ma=
y actually have helped you consider homam at this time! When a new soul com=
es near you, it causes changes based on its nature. You may stop homam for =
a few days after delivery. But you can do it without any worries until then=
. 4. Yes! 5. An auspicious day for the first homam is a good idea. But we (=
people of this age) are not really that good in identifying auspicious time=
s. Our knowledge is weak. So pray to Devi Ma and start when convenient. In =
any case, this month is very good. Rishi Panchami (in 1-2 days) and Vaisakh=
a Pournami are awesome days. In fact, first fortnight of Vaisakha month is =
very auspicious over all. 6. Doing at home creates a positive energy at hom=
e and so good. But many open spaces and natural settings are more conducive=
 to divine presence. Do wherever it is convenient. All the best! Thanks,Nar=

Namaste Narasim=
haji, 
I feel blessed to have chanced upon this yahoo group! For the last c=
ouple of years, I have witnessed a gradual yet strong inclination towards s=
pirituality, religion, rituals, yoga, ayurveda and jyotish. I have been rea=
ding a lot about them, mostly via the internet, some readings more helpful =
than others, but each drawing me closer towards learning more and understan=

most lucid explanation of spirituality, and the final goal of every saadhan=
a, and the link between spirituality and rituals, yoga, ayurveda, and leadi=
ng a simple and humble life. 
I have downloaded the book compiled from your=
 writings on spiritual matters and I am in the process of reading that as w=
ell, and derive great happiness in reading it. I also visited your website =
and saw a wealth of material for spiritually inclined people there. The man=
uals on do-it-yourself homams are one of your outstanding contributions to =
society, and shine brightly among the other gems of your contributions. I f=
eel an inclination towards performing homams on a daily/weekly basis. Befor=
e I start this, I want to seek your guidance on the following: 
1. Do I nee=
d to prepare myself in any way before I start the homam?- I will explain to=
 you what I mean here - since you have suggested that one start with MahaGa=
napathi homam, I shall start with it too. However, as I have been worshippi=
ng DeviMa every morning and Hanumanji every evening, do I need to start wor=
shipping MahaGanapathi now for a few days during mornings and evenings and =
then after a few days, start with the homam? 
2. Related to the first quest=
ion, as I have been worshipping DeviMa for quite sometime now, I see/visual=
ize Her many times during the day (at work/home), so now when I start with =
the MahaGanapathi homam with complete faith, devotion, and surrender to Mah=
aGanapathi, wouldn't there be a conflict in my mind, since I may still be v=
isualizing DeviMa everywhere around me (due to mind's conditioning), while =
I am worshipping MahaGanapathi as the One who is the source, cradle and end=
 of everything, and hence shoule be visualizing Him instead? This may be a =
hypothetical situation, as I am talking about the future, however, may stil=
l be relevant, and so I seek your advice here. 
3. As I am householder, and=
 we are expecting our first child in the next few months, is it ok to perfo=
rm a homam at home? It may sound jouvenile but I don't know any better, and=
 would rather listen to wiser men. The reason I ask this is that while doin=
g the homam, we chant various mantras/stotras, and they produce effects in =
the immediate environment, specially in the presence of Agni, the Pavaka. A=
lthough, the goal of my saadhana is to decondition my mimd to move towards =
greater purity, humility and peace, and I have faith that a regular homam w=
ill enable me to achieve that. However, for the sake of my wife and our chi=
ld (inside her womb), I am prompted to ask this question. Please don't take=
 it in any other way except as a genuine concern for my family (however sil=
ly it is) 
4. Related to the above question, if it is fine for me to do the=
 homam at home, then can my pregnant wife also participate in it, if she wa=
nts to? 
5. Should I wait for an auspicious day like an amavasya or an ecli=
pse to start the homam, or is any day fine? Similarly, should I do the homa=
m at a particular time every day or is any time fine? I do understand that =
doing the homam/any saadhana at the same time everyday, whatever time one d=
oes it, is more beneficial than doing it at different times. 
6. Is it bett=
er to do the homam at home or can it be done elsewhere as well? The reason =
I ask this is we are living in a rented accomodation and the smoke from the=
 homam may blacken the walls and the ceiling. However, in our residential/a=
partment complex, there is a common area, which is open on two sides, where=
 some community festivals are celebrated together, and if I get the permiss=
ion, then maybe I can do the homam there? Is there a strong reason/added be=
nefit to doing the homam at home? 
Narasimhaji, I will be very grateful to =
you for your answers to the above questions. 
You are rendering a great ser=
vice to today's society and we pray to DeviMa to keep showing you the way. =

Thank you for sharing so much! 
Humble regards, Vipin
