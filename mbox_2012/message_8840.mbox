Dear Narasimha,


I have a slightly different view about the first point, t=
hough I agree to what you are saying.

1. Of course the analogy of Sun and =
Sunlight is valid, but the more interesting question remains why was there =
a clear thrust on the Sun in the spiritual literature in Gita while the ter=
minology shifted to Sunlight in Tantras. One can adopt the mystics attitude=
 and welcome, without analysing, all variations of spiritual experience. Or=
 one can adopt the philosophical-spiritual attitude and try to find a flow =
of how and why this shift happened. In India we have a solid tradition of b=
oth these two manners of treating Divine knowledge and experience. A more f=
undamental query also comes up, and which holds the key to this question (I=
MHO), is why does Sri Krishna never mention the word Kundalini in the Gita.=


2. To understand this we must start with acknowledging certain obvious fa=
cts as they come to us. The Gita (Upanishadic tradition) does not look at s=
pirituality from the fulcrum of Kundalini. Neither is it the first experien=
ce, nor a sufficient parameter for judgement. It is rather an inevitable pr=
ocess in the journey, which can happen in day one, or the very last day. By=
 itself, just by an awakening of the K shakti, one does not become spiritua=
l, neither can it be said that if one has not had an experience of the K sh=
akti yet, one is not making progress spiritually. But by the time of the Ha=
tha Yogic traditions, Nath Yogis, and Tantra, the understanding of spiritua=
lity became entirely Kundalini centric.

3. Kundalini as we read and hear o=
f it today, IMO, is insufficiently understood. The maximum that books or pe=
ople speak of is the standard diagramAtic knowledge of chakras and Shakti r=
ising up. Some correlation of this can be felt, but it is in greatest depth=
 still a mental concept and at times pretty vague and speculative. That is =
because this knowledge was passed down from capable gurus to capable discip=
les, and it needed a blind adherence to the words of a physical Guru for th=
e process of kundalinI sadhana to change a person into someone truly spirit=
ual. Hence the primacy of hanging on blindly to the Guru. The diagramtic li=
near understanding that we have of the K process has gaps, and can very oft=
en give a lopsided view of things. For example the diagram of a man sitting=
 with chakras and Shakti rising up is actual a two-dimensional representati=
on of a multidimensional phenomenon, highly prone to misunderstanding. The =
influence of each of the chakras
 pervade the whole life of a person. They =
overlap each other. Each represent psychological functions of the human org=
anism. Activating or deactiving specific petals of each chakra is important=
 and vital for sadhana of each speicifc individual, which a Guru can decide=
 accurately. The diagramatic centers only represent the focal point of that=
 range of pyschological functions, but the sphere of influence of each chak=
ra can permeate into the whole system and consequently into life in general=
. It is impossible for any sadhaka to navigate the path, with a K centric v=
iew of spirituality, unless guided constantly by a physical guru of great d=
epth, knowledge and wisdom abouit Kundalini Yoga. Otherwise, like Columbus,=
 one will start for India and end up reaching America.

4. The concept of G=
uru and Shishya was always there, but in the Gita and Upanishads, Guru was =
the Guru tattwa, which can manifest from an individual, or through anything=
 provided the disciple is ready. Like Dattatreya had 24 non-human gurus. Bu=
t this kind of concept of Guru is impractical when it comes to Kundalini Yo=
ga. One can become genuinely spiritual by contemplating and trying to imbib=
e the advice of Krishna in the Gita without a physical Guru. Same cannot be=
 done in Kundalini centric view of sadhana.

5. In the Gita tradition, or f=
or that matter any spiritual tradition, Kundalini will awaken for sure, but=
 since spirituality is not looked at from that prism, therefore this proces=
s is left to Nature to happen on its own, when a sadhaka is ready internall=
y. Moreover, the judgement of spirituality - whether a person is spiritual =
or non-spiritual - cannot be made based merely on an experience of Kundalin=
i itself. Until the K shakti rises up to meet the higher spiritual realms a=
nd brings down those energies into life, and then those energies settle dow=
n into the system, actual spiritual effects may not be visible.

6. The Kun=
dalini is the force of the pranamayakosha which holds the external personal=
ity together. The aim is to liberate it from its mundane function and make =
it shoot-up to purify itself. Every time it comes into contact with the hig=
her planes, it imbibes the energies and bring them down into life. The pran=
amayakosha is pure shakti, constantly in motion. This is a tremendous force=
. Because Force in its original nature is the domain of the Mother, the dyn=
amic aspect of Sat-Chit-Ananda, therefore Kundalini is called Shakti sadhan=
a or Mother Kundalini.

7. In the light of the above points, it can be fair=
ly understood why the Gita puts its trust on Purushottama, while the Tantra=
s - whose spiritual prism was Kundalini centric - puts the focus on Adya Sh=
akti.

8. In this age when Guurus are rare, genuine paramparas are rarer st=
ill, and capable sadhaks are negligible, a Kundalini centric view of sadhan=
a can be detrimental for most people.

9. Of course, these are my view-poin=
t as I see it. Feel free to disagree.

-Regards

Question 1:
=C2=A0
Ramakrishna said that Krishna is like Sun and K=
ali is like the sun's rays, light, heat etc. Without rays, Sun does not fun=

ether. Whether they are one or different is a matter of perspective and sem=

I may also give a different analogy. A=
 suppressed spring has potential energy. When it is released, some potentia=
l energy is
 *converted* into kinetic energy. But potential energy and kine=
tic energy are not really two different things. They are two aspects of the=
 same and converted from one to another. Similarly, Purusha is the potentia=
l energy and Shakti is the kinetic energy.
=C2=A0
Purushottama is like the =
cumulative [spiritual] potential energy of the cosmos that is about to go t=
hrough the big bang. Adya shakti is like the cumulative [spiritual] kinetic=
 energy of the cosmos after the big bang. Purushottama and Adya Shakti are =
not really different and two aspects of the same. When something needs to b=
e done in the cosmos, Purushottama projects himself as his Shakti and thing=
s happen.

The su=
preme kinetic energy (feminine element) of cosmos is of three types - one t=
hat causes objectification in consciousness, one that sustains objectificat=
ion in consciousness and one that ends objectification in consciousness. Th=
ese three aspects are represented by Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswat=
i, the deities of the 3 charitras of Saptashati or Chandipath or Devi Mahat=
myam.
=C2=A0
Various higher beings emanate from these three basic types of =
higher kinetic energy to aid in the respective high level processes. Please=
 bear in mind that different male deities represents different types of pot=
ential energy of consciousness, playing specific roles based on the combina=
tion of gunas, and different
 female deities represent different types of k=
inetic energy within consciousness, again playing specific roles based on t=
he combination of gunas. It is all play of energies in the end.

To cause objectification in consciousness, the kinetic e=
nergy of consciousness needs to be stirred and rajas-ified and the potentia=
l energy of consciousness needs to be withdrawn/reduced, stopped and tamas-=
ified. These two energies are represented by Saraswati and Rudra.
=C2=A0
To=
 sustain objectification already present in consciousness, the kinetic ener=
gy of consciousness needs to be in a stable and clear equilibrium and sattv=
-ified and the potential energy of consciousness needs to be stirred and ra=
jas-ified. These two energies are represented by Lakshmi and Brahma.

To end objectification already present in consciousness, the kinetic
 ener=
gy of consciousness needs to be withdrawn/reduced, stopped and tamas-ified =
and the potential energy of consciousness needs to be in a stable and clear=
 equilibrium and sattv-ified. These two energies are represented by Gouri a=

BTW, Narayana or Purushottama is th=
e absolute potential energy of cosmos. The initial Mahalakshmi is the proje=
ction of that potential energy as kinetic energy. Don't worry too much abou=
t the names. She is not the same as Mahalakshmi of the 3 Mahadevis just bec=
ause of the name. She could as well have been called Aadyaa Shakti or Naara=
ayani. To remove confusion, we may call her Aadyaadi Mahalakshmi (in the te=
rminology of Lakshmi Hridayam from "Atharva Rahasyam", which is one of my f=
avorite prayers). Aadyaadi Mahalakshmi personifies the entire kinetic energ=
y of
 cosmos.

=C2=A0
This reminds me of an incident. =
One person was doing daily Chandi homam and invoking Mahalakshmi as the mai=
n deity. He was using the dhyana shloka for Mahalakshmi from "Vaikritika Ra=
hasyam" (shvetAnanA nIlabhujA sushveta stana maNDalA...). He later switched=
 to a different dhyana shloka - the one for Adyadi Mahalakshmi from whom Ma=
hakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati came - from "Pradhanika Rahasyam" (sa=
rvasyAdyA mahAlakShmIH trigunA parameshvarI...), thinking that it was super=
ior.
=C2=A0
His guru told him after a few months, "whatever dhyana shloka y=
ou use, know its meaning and physically imagine someone in that form". He c=
ame and asked me for the meaning. I discouraged him, "I don't think you rea=
lly want to know the meaning and physically imagine someone in that form". =
When he insisted, I told him the
 meaning.
=C2=A0
The verses describe Mahal=
akshmi who is the "First among all" (sarvasya AdyA) and having all 3 gunas.=
 She is described as holding in her hands a liquor bowl, snake, male genita=
l, female genital, king's head etc. Of course, if one starts imagining such=
 a form, it may distract one's mind based on one's conditioning!
=C2=A0
*=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The thing here is that these symbols represent some s=
ubtle things. The "Initial Kinetic Energy" from which whole creation came a=
bout obviously works by intoxicating parts of consciousness with notions (l=
iquor bowl), giving rise to notions of gender and identity (male and female=
 genitals), self-awareness/Kundalini (snake), egosense (king's head) etc. W=
hen one is dealing with such Initial or high level energies, concepts becom=
e subtle/abstract. If one wants an explicit outer form, it is better to ima=
gine
 slightly lower level manifestations with specific gunas and purposes.=

=C2=A0
Let me say it in different words. The Kinetic energy of Purushottam=
a is beyond our thoughts, perception and imagination. Various descriptions =
and imagery in various scriptures are very likely to be misunderstood by us=
 based on our conditioning. It's just too hi-fi for foolish and egoistic ig=
noramuses of Kali yuga, like us.

Dear =

I had two questions on which I wanted you views.
=C2=A0
1=
 - In the Gita we find a philosophy which focuses on Purushottama=C2=A0 as =

=C2=A0
2 - This question is more complex. I read and re-read the Pr=

Mahakali comes out Shiva and Saraswati, from Mahalakshmi comes Brahma and L=

Confusing on apparent meaning. I mean, why were the couple-forms c=

Th=

I obviously have no such thing, and could not, even mentally,

     *<br> <br>Question 1:<br> <br>Ramakrishn=
a said that Krishna is like Sun and Kali is like the sun's rays, light, hea=

rays without Sun. Sun and rays go together. Whether they are one or differe=

ential energy. When it is released, some potential energy is
 *converted* i=
nto kinetic energy. But potential energy and kinetic energy are not really =
two different things. They are two aspects of the same and converted from o=
ne to another. Similarly, Purusha is the potential energy and Shakti is the=
 kinetic energy.<br> <br>Purushottama is like the cumulative [spiritua=
l] potential energy of the cosmos that is about to go through the big bang.=
 Adya shakti is like the cumulative [spiritual] kinetic energy of the cosmo=
s after the big bang. Purushottama and Adya Shakti are not really different=
 and two aspects of the same. When something needs to be done in the cosmos=
, Purushottama projects himself as his Shakti and things happen.<br> <=
br>*        *    &nb=
sp;   *<br> <br>Question 2:<br> <br>This is a great que=
stion and I never thought of it before. Thanks for asking and making me thi=
nk. Please note that I too do not have "eyes of gyana"
 and just speculatin=
g based on my intuition and sharing my thoughts unfiltered. If it makes no =
sense, please feel free to ignore. <br> <br>*    &=
nbsp;   *        *<br> <b=
r>The supreme kinetic energy (feminine element) of cosmos is of three types=
 - one that causes objectification in consciousness, one that sustains obje=
ctification in consciousness and one that ends objectification in conscious=
ness. These three aspects are represented by Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Maha=
saraswati, the deities of the 3 charitras of Saptashati or Chandipath or De=
vi Mahatmyam.<br> <br>Various higher beings emanate from these three b=
asic types of higher kinetic energy to aid in the respective high level pro=
cesses. Please bear in mind that different male deities represents differen=
t types of potential energy of consciousness, playing specific roles based =
on the combination of gunas, and different
 female deities represent differ=
ent types of kinetic energy within consciousness, again playing specific ro=
les based on the combination of gunas. It is all play of energies in the en=
d.<br> <br>*        *  &n=
bsp;     *<br> <br>To cause objectification in con=
sciousness, the kinetic energy of consciousness needs to be stirred and raj=
as-ified and the potential energy of consciousness needs to be withdrawn/re=
duced, stopped and tamas-ified. These two energies are represented by Saras=
wati and Rudra.<br> <br>To sustain objectification already present in =
consciousness, the kinetic energy of consciousness needs to be in a stable =
and clear equilibrium and sattv-ified and the potential energy of conscious=
ness needs to be stirred and rajas-ified. These two energies are represente=
d by Lakshmi and Brahma.<br> <br>To end objectification already presen=
t in consciousness, the kinetic
 energy of consciousness needs to be withdr=
awn/reduced, stopped and tamas-ified and the potential energy of consciousn=
ess needs to be in a stable and clear equilibrium and sattv-ified. These tw=
o energies are represented by Gouri and Vishnu.<br> <br>*  &=
nbsp;     *        *=
<br> <br>BTW, Narayana or Purushottama is the absolute potential energ=
y of cosmos. The initial Mahalakshmi is the projection of that potential en=
ergy as kinetic energy. Don't worry too much about the names. She is not th=
e same as Mahalakshmi of the 3 Mahadevis just because of the name. She coul=
d as well have been called Aadyaa Shakti or Naaraayani. To remove confusion=
, we may call her Aadyaadi Mahalakshmi (in the terminology of Lakshmi Hrida=
yam from "Atharva Rahasyam", which is one of my favorite prayers). Aadyaadi=
 Mahalakshmi personifies the entire kinetic energy of
 cosmos.<br> <br=
>*        *     =
;   *<br> <br>This reminds me of an incident. One person was=
 doing daily Chandi homam and invoking Mahalakshmi as the main deity. He wa=
s using the dhyana shloka for Mahalakshmi from "Vaikritika Rahasyam" (shvet=
AnanA nIlabhujA sushveta stana maNDalA...). He later switched to a differen=
t dhyana shloka - the one for Adyadi Mahalakshmi from whom Mahakali, Mahala=
kshmi and Mahasaraswati came - from "Pradhanika Rahasyam" (sarvasyAdyA mahA=
lakShmIH trigunA parameshvarI...), thinking that it was superior.<br> =
<br>His guru told him after a few months, "whatever dhyana shloka you use, =
know its meaning and physically imagine someone in that form". He came and =
asked me for the meaning. I discouraged him, "I don't think you really want=
 to know the meaning and physically imagine someone in that form". When he =
insisted, I told him the
 meaning.<br> <br>The verses describe Mahalak=
shmi who is the "First among all" (sarvasya AdyA) and having all 3 gunas. S=
he is described as holding in her hands a liquor bowl, snake, male genital,=
 female genital, king's head etc. Of course, if one starts imagining such a=
 form, it may distract one's mind based on one's conditioning!<br> <br=
>*        *     =
;   *<br> <br>The thing here is that these symbols represent=
 some subtle things. The "Initial Kinetic Energy" from which whole creation=
 came about obviously works by intoxicating parts of consciousness with not=
ions (liquor bowl), giving rise to notions of gender and identity (male and=
 female genitals), self-awareness/Kundalini (snake), egosense (king's head)=
 etc. When one is dealing with such Initial or high level energies, concept=
s become subtle/abstract. If one wants an explicit outer form, it is better=
 to imagine
 slightly lower level manifestations with specific gunas and pu=
rposes.<br> <br>Let me say it in different words. The Kinetic energy o=
f Purushottama is beyond our thoughts, perception and imagination. Various =
descriptions and imagery in various scriptures are very likely to be misund=
erstood by us based on our conditioning. It's just too hi-fi for foolish an=
d egoistic ignoramuses of Kali yuga, like us.<br> <br>Best regards,<br=
