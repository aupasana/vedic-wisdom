I would like to add some more point in addition to PVR ji has told

Similarily the so called rit=

but once you go to a different stage=
 we should drop the rituals=C2=A0 and procedures=C2=A0 

I would like to qu=
ote a poem from thirumanthiram 

"manamthu chemmaiyanal manthiram athu thev=
ayillai" means 

If mind is well matured there is no need of chanting mantr=
a
That does not mean that you have to stop chanting=C2=A0 mantra 

One has =
to chant till he acheives that particular state of mind=C2=A0=C2=A0

 sadhana, not just Tantra. Even so called Vedic Sadhanas ar=
