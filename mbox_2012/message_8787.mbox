numbers
 

=C2=A0 
Ram Ram,
( Play this while reading -----=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DIn3XdRxI-kA=C2=A0 )

A couple of point=
s ----->

	* Ghee and the Dry offering=C2=A0 ------- Have you ever had a so=
okhi roti? That is a prantha without ghee? It can satiate your hunger, but =
you always know, that something was missing. A sookha fulka is a little les=
s joyous to eat than one with ghee. Don't use the word 'dosha' it will driv=
e people away. It is not a dosha. Mr Agni likes the offering with ghee, he =
prefers it that way, but accepts it otherwise too. Not offering with ghee d=
oes not result in a 'dosha' in the traditional sense of the word. See, the =
person who said that it results in 'dosha' might have a very different defi=
nition of this word, to the one that many will comprehend. For him/her, it =
might be regular usage for a simple 'fault', for somebody reading it might =
be " OMFG, What the hell have I done? I did a Dosha for so long!!" Oh well,=
 calm down. Even if you committed a dosha, what the hell have you been doin=
g when you are reading that "anagyatam, yadagyatam, yagasya kriyte mithu...=
."
 section. You are apologizing specifically to Mr Agni, aren't you? Thus =
you have already said sorry for this, so next time onwards, just put a litt=
le ghee to whatever you offer. it helps Mr Agni, to carry it forward or to =
accept it depending on the situation, and as you are hosting him it is your=
 paramount duty to take care of him when he comes. He comes and actually do=
es a favor to you. Revere him, he tolerates our foolishness and ignorance a=
nd does not burn our house/us down in anger=C2=A0 ( very capable of doing s=
o ), thus help him out and treat him with honor. He is a living being. bein=
g hot is his nature, I am not talking about Paris hilton waala "hot" here. =
An offering with ghee, helps him out when compared to a dry one, but he sti=
ll accepts the latter, but prefers the former.

	* Regarding the ratios and=
 everything else ----=C2=A0 
A purusha-acharana is too complex and requires=
 an extreme amount of discipline to complete. Concepts detailing to mantra =
siddhi and all that, but walk on to these paths when the basics are there. =
The best part is , when the basics are complete, god will automatically gra=
duate you tot his level, it might take 10 days, or 10 years, or 10 months, =
who the hell knows apart from Mr god a.k.a the form of your god you are wor=
shiping? Anyone doing a simple homam, like many are, need not worry about t=
he ratios AS OF NOW. If a stage comes later, that you become "big" enough t=
o apply some rules to your penance, or maybe you are headed down some speci=
fic route, and you need to do it as per instructions from your teacher( god=
 )/ or aadesh from inside, do it. If you are getting confused with 10 times=
 then one, or 100 times then one or what om and what tarpyami or what swaha=
..... chuck it. Just offer the mantra in the fire, with utter sincerity and=
 forget that you ever
 offered too. If you are to be taken on a path that r=
equires the ratios, you will be taken, no issues. Till then, keep offering =
the single repetition just like, you are now. Unless and until, significant=
 penance is done, theory about ratios and how it all works, will go over ou=
r heads, and confuse even further. It is useless to discuss it, will only g=
ive rise to more debates and confusion galore. Spend time chanting instead.=


	* One more pointer, since I think I read somewhere as to how we can impr=
ove our homams. Offer any thing to the fire with love, I sometimes notice, =
people throwing stuff in, or maybe due to the fear of getting burnt, pullin=
g the hand away extremely quickly. Remember you are feeding someone, and th=
at someone is an extremely ALIVE being, the one who sits in front of you an=
d makes you sweat. You ever notice how a mother feeds her child bites of fo=
od, even though the fingers are always at risk of getting bitten and coming=
 back with a coat of gooey saliva? Thore se pyaar se, feed Mr Agni, he will=
 appreciate it. He always does. Maybe you can modify your hand movement and=
 integrate some grace in the way an offering is made, doesn't matter even i=
f it is made from a distance. It can take some time getting used to, practi=
ce makes perfect!=C2=A0
	* A sub pointer in improving your homam is the app=
reciation of the fact of the suffering of the offering! Bow down to your go=
las , the tils , the mithai,=C2=A0 the ghee, "spiritual progress tumhaari, =
jalegi humari" seems to be the chant from whatever you are offering!! LOL .=
 Mind you, somebody is jumping straight in to Mr agni's mouth on your behes=
t, the gola nariyaal you so gladly cut inside out, ouch the pain!! Because =
those too are manifestations of the same divine and their sacrifice is supr=
eme, thus bow down and sincerely thank god for manifesting and providing yo=
u the material to do this wonderful ritual.

Ram Ram,<br>( Play this while reading -----    http://ww=
w.youtube.com/watch?v=3DIn3XdRxI-kA  )<br><br>A couple of points -----=
><br></div><ul><li>Ghee and the Dry offering  ------- Have you ever=
 had a sookhi roti? That is a prantha without ghee? It can satiate your hun=
ger, but you always know, that something was missing. A sookha fulka is a l=
ittle less joyous to eat than one with ghee. Don't use the word 'dosha' it =
will drive people away. It is not a dosha. Mr Agni likes the offering with =
ghee, he prefers it that way, but accepts it otherwise too. Not offering wi=
th ghee does not result in a 'dosha' in the traditional sense of the word. =
See, the person who said that it results in 'dosha' might have a very diffe=
rent definition of this word, to the one that many will comprehend. For him=
/her, it might be regular usage for a simple 'fault', for somebody reading =
it might be " OMFG, What the hell have I done? I did a Dosha for so
 long!!=
" Oh well, calm down. Even if you committed a dosha, what the hell have you=
 been doing when you are reading that "anagyatam, yadagyatam, yagasya kriyt=
e mithu...." section. You are apologizing specifically to Mr Agni, aren't y=
ou? Thus you have already said sorry for this, so next time onwards, just p=
ut a little ghee to whatever you offer. it helps Mr Agni, to carry it forwa=
rd or to accept it depending on the situation, and as you are hosting him i=
t is your paramount duty to take care of him when he comes. He comes and ac=
tually does a favor to you. Revere him, he tolerates our foolishness and ig=
norance and does not burn our house/us down in anger  ( very capable o=
f doing so ), thus help him out and treat him with honor. He is a living be=
ing. being hot is his nature, I am not talking about Paris hilton waala "ho=
t" here. An offering with ghee, helps him out when compared to a dry one, b=
ut he still accepts the latter, but prefers the
 former.<br></li><li>Regard=
ing the ratios and everything else ----  <br>A purusha-acharana is too=
 complex and requires an extreme amount of discipline to complete. Concepts=
 detailing to mantra siddhi and all that, but walk on to these paths when t=
he basics are there. The best part is , when the basics are complete, god w=
ill automatically graduate you tot his level, it might take 10 days, or 10 =
years, or 10 months, who the hell knows apart from Mr god a.k.a the form of=
 your god you are worshiping? Anyone doing a simple homam, like many are, n=
eed not worry about the ratios AS OF NOW. If a stage comes later, that you =
become "big" enough to apply some rules to your penance, or maybe you are h=
eaded down some specific route, and you need to do it as per instructions f=
rom your teacher( god )/ or aadesh from inside, do it. If you are getting c=
onfused with 10 times then one, or 100 times then one or what om and what t=
arpyami or what swaha..... chuck it. Just
 offer the mantra in the fire, wi=
th utter sincerity and forget that you ever offered too. If you are to be t=
aken on a path that requires the ratios, you will be taken, no issues. Till=
 then, keep offering the single repetition just like, you are now. Unless a=
nd until, significant penance is done, theory about ratios and how it all w=
orks, will go over our heads, and confuse even further. It is useless to di=
scuss it, will only give rise to more debates and confusion galore. Spend t=
ime chanting instead.<br></li><li>One more pointer, since I think I read so=
mewhere as to how we can improve our homams. Offer any thing to the fire wi=
th love, I sometimes notice, people throwing stuff in, or maybe due to the =
fear of getting burnt, pulling the hand away extremely quickly. Remember yo=
u are feeding someone, and that someone is an extremely ALIVE being, the on=
e who sits in front of you and makes you sweat. You ever notice how a mothe=
r feeds her child bites of food,
 even though the fingers are always at ris=
k of getting bitten and coming back with a coat of gooey saliva? Thore se p=
yaar se, feed Mr Agni, he will appreciate it. He always does. Maybe you can=
 modify your hand movement and integrate some grace in the way an offering =
is made, doesn't matter even if it is made from a distance. It can take som=
e time getting used to, practice makes perfect! </li><li>A sub pointer=
 in improving your homam is the appreciation of the fact of the suffering o=
f the offering! Bow down to your golas , the tils , the mithai,  the g=
hee, "spiritual progress tumhaari, jalegi humari" seems to be the chant fro=
m whatever you are offering!! LOL . Mind you, somebody is jumping straight =
in to Mr agni's mouth on your behest, the gola nariyaal you so gladly cut i=
nside out, ouch the pain!! Because those too are manifestations of the same=
 divine and their sacrifice is supreme, thus bow down and sincerely thank g=
od for manifesting and
 providing you the material to do this wonderful rit=
ual.</li></ul><div>Ram Ram</div><div>-- Baccha Singh<br></div>Now watch thi=
