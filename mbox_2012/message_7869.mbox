Aghora 2 , has a beautiful Sub - chapter on Ganpathi.
Secondly, When you st=
ate, "only those two are real or the most powerful.", contemplate on this s=
tatement yourself. Are you looking to worship the most powerful deity or th=
e most real deity? I know you will reply with "I didn't mean that" and I kn=
ow "you don't mean that", but still ponder why the statement. V sir's deity=
 is ma in the form of Tara ma, but point is it still is ma, no matter what =
the form. And v sir is extremely fond of ganesh ji. You can read a bit in A=
ghora 2.

Thirdly Jitender, do a ganpathi homam, and ask Ganeshji to tell y=
ou a book which he thinks will lead you to more insights of him. Who said y=
ou can't talk to him? Next time, ask. And better still, why don't you ask h=
im to tell you all about himself. And he will. Many will say , I have gone =
mad to tell you the above, but do try and trust him. He will answer. All th=
at is required is humble faith and sincerity. You will get your answer. And=
 read the Aghora books again, you will get much more insights on ganpathi t=
han roaming around here and there.

P.S. next time you do a homam, do ask h=
ello how have you been and please tell me some books or tell me by yourself=
. ;)

Warm Regards,
Nobody
