The way i see it: we are consciousness"embodied" manifesting it at various
=
"levels" , slowly unwinding over a period of time at the "earth plane" .
di=
vine mother is the supreme consciousness , when we appeal to her, our
indiv=
idual consciousness is able to get out of the dense conditioning thats
rest=
ricting its prefection.
