Hi, =A0
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0also, to attain the formless God that is beyond th=
em both.

wow, wow, wow =A0Who told you this thing? Was it Dalai Lama? Was =
he telling you about --Shonya-- and other things to entice you to his side?=
 It is not fair. We need you on our side.Pleezzzz

There is no formless God=
 that is beyond them Both.In the old days Kings/Queens will keep someone ne=
ar them in their kingdom and also send some other to far away place which i=
s in their kingdom as well. The far away place is full of bliss and the per=
son is submerged in it and would lose their identity. Near person will rema=
in with the Divine Beings and would experience love& affection, bliss&happi=
ness holi& Diwali with their identity.

=A0You know what, the thing is that=
 you have had not yet the Darshan of Divine Mother. It has not happened wit=
h you that Divine Mother has called you and given HER MANTRA to you. It has=
 not yet happened that you are coming back from a Temple in India and you a=
re weeping uncontrollably because you do not know when you will come back. =
you have not yet received your pass so you can enter in to Her Lila. I gues=
s you will have to just wait for door to open. And once this happens you wi=
ll change many of your thought as sure as sun rises in the east.
It is true=
 someone can go in to that bliss state without having a Darshan of Divine B=
eings. It is also true that after reaching that bliss state one can have Da=
rshan as well. I prefer and want to hold the Feet of Divine Mother.

I have=
 tickled you so many times so you have to give me some suggestions now. Eve=
ryday I recite several prayers and mantras in a continuous stream for so ma=
ny hours.I dare not say how many.I also do similar thing for my mother who =
is very old, sitting next to her and placing my hand her head. Last several=
 months my throat muscles have become very tired and painful. I know using =
honey and warm water sometimes help. Any workable suggestions from you and =
other devotees would be really appreciated.

Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Hi LaxmiNarayanji,

It's very interesting t=
o hear about your experiences with the Name. 

I agree with your suggestion=
 that She be worshipped for Her sake as well, not just for attaining Him. B=
ut in my mind, Durga, Lakshmi, Hari and Hara are all One, so I feel I worsh=
ip them all when I say the mantra Om NamoNarayanaya (for that matter, I fee=
l I worship Allah, Buddha and Jehovah too when I repeat this mantra). I fee=
l all these exist in Narayana. While I love the forms of Hari and Durga esp=
ecially, and find them the easiest to talk to, I also find the forms of Rad=
ha and Shiva enchantingly beautiful. The Hare Krishnas say that Krishna can=
 only be attained through the Grace of Radha. Many saints have said in the =
past that the mother is always easily accessible, always close to her child=
ren, keeping an eye on them and they can speak with her freely.....the fath=
er tends to be a bit more distant....and only the Mother can introduce a ch=
ild to it's Father! This idea sort of appeals to my mind. So I pester/worsh=
ip Durga to attain both Hari and Her too
 (they are One of course). And als=
o, to attain the formless God that is beyond them both. I feel it is She wh=
o keeps me on the path, and keeps my sadhana going. Without her, there's no=
 doubt, that all would be lost. 

Dubeyji,

Thanks for the links....I found=
 the articles very interesting. Not quite sure what to make of the one on s=
leep paralysis, but all I can say is, I will certainly keep up the chanting=
 before bedtime! 

Best wishes,

Aparna

 your suggestion that She be worshipped for Her sake as well, not just for =
attaining Him. But in my mind, <span id=3D"misspell-14" class=3D"mark">Durg=
a</span>, Lakshmi, <span id=3D"misspell-15"
 class=3D"mark">Hari</span> and=
 <span id=3D"misspell-16" class=3D"mark">Hara</span> are all One, so I feel=
 I worship them all when I say the mantra Om <span id=3D"misspell-17" class=

pan> (for that matter, I feel I worship Allah, Buddha and Jehovah too when =
I repeat this mantra). I feel all these exist in <span id=3D"misspell-19" c=
lass=3D"mark">Narayana</span>. While I love the forms of <span id=3D"misspe=
ll-20" class=3D"mark">Hari</span> and <span id=3D"misspell-21" class=3D"mar=
k">Durga</span> especially, and find them the easiest to talk to, I also fi=
nd the forms of <span id=3D"misspell-22" class=3D"mark">Radha</span> and Sh=
iva enchantingly beautiful. The Hare <span id=3D"misspell-23" class=3D"mark=
">Krishnas</span> say that Krishna can only be attained through the Grace o=
f <span id=3D"misspell-24" class=3D"mark">Radha</span>. Many saints have sa=

 her children, keeping an eye on them and they can speak with her freely..=
...the father tends to be a bit more distant....and only the Mother can int=
roduce a child to it's Father! This idea sort of appeals to my mind. So I p=

n both <span id=3D"misspell-26" class=3D"mark">Hari</span> and Her too (the=
y are One of course). And also, to attain the formless God that is beyond t=
hem both. I feel it is She who keeps me on the path, and keeps my <span id=

no doubt, that all would be lost. <br><br><span id=3D"misspell-28" class=3D=

 the en=

e and glancing in this direction is rather sweet. You've motivated me to do=
 the mantra with even more enthusiasm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her =
for help with this......Ramakrishna says you have to keep tugging at Her sa=

the Name provides protection against dodgy situations. I don't like to thin=

 scared of the dark since childhood, slowly getting over it now. <br>> <=
br>> Once at university, around 7 years ago, I was preparing for some ex=
ams. It was after term-time and I had stayed back to revise.  I was mo=
ved to a room that was different to the one I had been staying in, as my us=
ual room was being used for some conference guests. I used to
 hang out wit=
h the Hare <span id=3D"misspell-43" class=3D"mark">Krishnas</span> then, an=
d was really into chanting the Hare Rama <span id=3D"misspell-44" class=3D"=
mark">mahamantra</span> then (still love this mantra, but chant Om <span id=
=3D"misspell-45" class=3D"mark">NamoNarayanaya</span> more now)- used to do=
 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. <br>> <br>> I was lying on m=
y back in this new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in some sort =
of light sleep state. At that point I had a very nasty sensation that can o=
nly be described as something or someone trying really hard to strangle me!=
 I felt very frightened, and couldn't move, speak or wake myself up.<br>>=
; <br>> In this state, my mind started repeating "<span id=3D"misspell-4=
6" class=3D"mark">Hari</span>, <span id=3D"misspell-47" class=3D"mark">Hari=
</span>, <span id=3D"misspell-48" class=3D"mark">Hari</span>,<span id=3D"mi=

 class=3D"m=

se it was short and I could say it very fast with concentration! The fright=
ening experience then passed and I felt the Name saved me.<br>> <br>>=
 I woke up and turned on the light feeling absolutely petrified and unable =
to go back to sleep. I then did something I wouldn't normally do. I rang th=
e <span id=3D"misspell-51" class=3D"mark">Sivananda</span> Yoga centre in L=
ondon at that time of night (I knew they don't sleep till about midnight as=
 I've stayed there) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Sw=
ami who initiated me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm,=
 she very kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it could have be=
en some real negative force or just something from my imagination. Either w=
ay, she reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repea=
ting the Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting
 before bedtim=
e to avoid similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the <span id=
=3D"misspell-52" class=3D"mark">Mahamantra</span> before going to bed and s=
lept fine (had to sleep with the light though on because I'm a coward ;).<b=
r>> <br>> Since then, I keep up the <span id=3D"misspell-53" class=3D=
"mark">practice</span> of repeating the Name before bedtime. I feel it keep=
s the err...nasties..away! And brings positive Divine energy to my mind ens=
