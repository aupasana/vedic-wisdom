The Ramayana, Mahabharata and the =
Bhagavada cannot be studied in isolation,
says Devdutt Pattanaik.****

** *=
*

In the Ramayana is the story of a bear called Jambavan who served Rama w=
ith
devotion, helping him along with the army of monkeys to attack Lanka an=
d
defeat the demon-king Ravana. It is said that he is a form of Brahma who
=
wanted to walk the earth along with Vishnu when the latter took the form of=

Rama. But during that time, he had a thought, "How I wish to fight with
Ra=
ma! But I cannot as I am his great devotee and admirer."****

** **

Rama d=
ivined Jambavan's thoughts and said, "In my next life, when I descend
as Kr=
ishna, you will get the opportunity to fight me." And so it came to
pass th=
at when Krishna was searching for the missing Syamantaka gem, he
found it w=
ith a bear cub who turned out to be Jambavan's son. When Krishna
tried to c=
laim it, Jambavan challenged him to a fight. And so they
wrestled, and as t=
hey wrestled, Jambavan realised that he was fighting the
man who was once R=
ama. His wish had been granted.****

** **

Another celestial deity who acc=
ompanied Vishnu on earth was Adi Sesha, the
serpent on whose coils sleeps V=
ishnu. When Vishnu was Rama, Adi Sesha was
Lakshmana and when Vishnu was Kr=
ishna, Adi Sesha was Balarama. Once
Lakshmana complained to Rama, "I am tir=
ed of agreeing with you because you
are my elder brother." So Rama said, "I=
n our next life, you will be the
elder brother and I will be the younger br=
other. You will still agree with
me because you will realise that you do so=
 not because I am elder or older
but because I always uphold dharma."****

=
** **

Stories linking the Indic epics, the Ramayana, the Bhagavada and the=

Mahabharata, are very common in mythology. Another story states that when
=
Ravana kidnapped Sita, Rama was inconsolable in his grief. All the trees
an=
d the animals and the men and women of the forest tried to hug him. But
he =
rejected their embrace. "Only Sita can touch me with such affection," he
sa=
id. Then he saw the disappointed faces of everyone around who was
reaching =
out to comfort him and said, "In my next life, when I am Krishna,
all of yo=
u shall be gopis and we shall dance together in Madhuvan."****

** **

Perh=
aps the most interesting link is the story connecting Vishnu's
relationship=
 with the sun god Surya and the rain god Indra. In the
Ramayana, Vishnu is =
Rama and he supports Sugriva, the son of Surya, in his
fight against Vali, =
the son of Indra. To balance the relationship in the
Mahabharata, Vishnu as=
 Krishna supports Indra's son, Arjuna, in his fight
against Surya's son, Ka=
rna. So what looks like unfairness in one life
becomes fair when one consid=
ers the previous life.****

** **

Thus, the events of Mahabharata and Bhag=
avada cannot be explained without
understanding events in the Ramayana. One=
 is the consequence while the
other is the cause. Why was this weaving of e=
pics done, one wonders. This
weaving turns every epic and every episode in =
the epic into pieces of a
vast jigsaw puzzle. To understand the entire puzz=
le you have to interlock
all the stories, characters and events.****

** **=


Nothing stands in isolation. Everything is dependent on something else.
T=
hus to know something about Indian mythology, you need to study all. And
so=
 it is in life. To understand your today, you have to understand
yesterday.=
 We are all products of the past. Today's Krishna was yesterday's
Rama and =
today's Kansa was yesterday's Ravana.****
