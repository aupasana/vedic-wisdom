namaste,

1) Yes (for Ketu)

2) 15 verses are there in Venkatesha Stotra. A=
fter each verse add Swahaa. for example: Swaha after "Sheshaadripatireva ch=
a", Swaha after "Madahavo Bhaktavatsal" and so on till the last verse. Plas=
e note that Whenever you are reciting the Stotra for the last time during H=
avan, you need to say "Vaushat" instead of Swahaa after "ShrimatVenkatnatha=
aya Srinivasaaya te namH" (Last Verse).

3) Hanuman Chalisa - It is called =
"Chalisa" because it is composed of 40 verses. So you are giving 40 Ahutis =
by saying Swahaa when you recite it once.

For example - 1st Swaha (and Viz=
-a-viz offerings) will be after "Jay Kapish tihu loka ujaagar", 2nd Swaha w=
ill be after "Anajani Putra Pavansut naamaa" and Last Swaha (or Vaushat dep=
ending upon the if you are repeating the Chalisa or otherwise) will be afte=
r Kije naath Hriday Mam dera"

Om Ketave NamaH
