Namaste to all,

Can somebody mention few yogic asana or exercises to stren=
ghthen your back of the body.
As i do homam and meditation, my back starts =
aching after 1 to 1.5 hours and i start feeling tired.

Any pointers apart =
from regular practice of meditation will be highly appreciated.

Thanks
