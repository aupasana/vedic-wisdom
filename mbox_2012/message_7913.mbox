Namaste,
=C2=A0
In any ritual that involves establishing a kalasha, the pri=
me philosophy is that the kalasha is representative of the mind of the indi=
vidual. The rice represents the body. The kalasha is thus placed on the ric=
e to act as a symbol of the mind in the=C2=A0body, and then the process of =
the ritual is followed to invoke certain energies/principles in the kalasha=
/mind of the devotee. In Navaratri kalasha the we ask the Goddess to fill t=
he mind with shakti needed for the whole year. In SatyaNarayana Puja, we as=
k the Lord of Truth to establish the mind firmly in its perception of truth=
(s) - from the lower apparent truths to higher eternal ones. Rice is almost=
 always used as a representative of the body. In my opinion, instead of ric=
e if you use mud from a river bank, that too will work. But rice has some o=
ther effects which mud will not produce.
=C2=A0
IF done accurately by a per=
son with good focus and some shakti, using rice in any ritual will augment =
all that is good for the body - which is a compound *mostly* of the earth a=
nd water element - and thus increase and attract prosperity of the material=
 kind. 
=C2=A0
Every part of=C2=A0any ritual is a confluence of symbolisms.=
 Activating the symbolism to produce verifiable result is a part of Tantra.=
 Rice can bring prosperity, til can download karmas faster, lime can break =
down negatives (if used correctly), honey can increase a feeling of interna=
l=C2=A0satisfaction, alcohol can make shakti rise at a furiously fast pace,=
 IF and ONLY IF, used by the right person in the right ritual, else disaste=
r.
=C2=A0
Similarly different animals have different symbolisms in=C2=A0 pr=
actical Tantra. A dog represents one level of divine guidance, a cow repres=
ents material prosperity, a pig represents the ability to survive through t=
hick and thin, a snake (depending on the ritual) can represent both etherea=
l beings of a lower plane to Shaktis of the highest order. A jackal represe=
nts some of the most interesting forms of the Goddess -=C2=A0very rare for =
most people.
=C2=A0
So that is why, IMO, rice is used as the base on which =
the kalasha is established.

=C2=A0 
Dear Narasimha,

When =
the main devata is established in a kalasha, it is usually placed
on a bed =
of rice. For example, your satyanarayana puja manual says
"place the kalash=
a on some grains of rice".

Often, a large amount of rice grains is used. D=
uring the puja process,
bits of flowers and various other odds and ends end=
 up getting strewn
on top of the rice. After the puja ends, all of this is =
mostly
unceremoniously discarded.

It there a symbolic spiritual reason beh=
ind placing rice under the
kalasha? Or it is just a practical reason -- kal=
ashas usually have a
rounded bottom, and the floor is not always flat. Plac=
ing it on a bed
of rice grains gives the kalasha some stability.

sasneham,=
