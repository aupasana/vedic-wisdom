Namaste

I came to know previously of Swami Sathsivom's work by Narasimha j=
i's writings.Below is one of the original messages from Narasimha ji about =
how the Divine mother gave the vision of starting Mahaganapati homam when N=
arasimha ji and Manish ji were at the Kalikambal temple in Chennai.

Swami Sathsivom recently =
consecrated a Shiva temple in San Jose california along with the deities of=
 Pratyangira Devi and I had the good fortune of visiting it yesterday.

It is with tears of g=
ratitude that I write this...have no other way to put it in words ...for th=
e first time in in life was blown away through a physical experience of the=
 divine in the Sri Pratyangira shrine. I consider the experience too sacred=
 to put it in words but it is something that cannot be explained by wordly =
reasoning.


All the discussions and books that I have read so far now seem=
 so chidlish compared to the one true experience I had ....my million salut=
ations to the feet  of Swami Sathsivom who has given an opportunity to even=
 normal people to experience the divine not in abstract terms  but as a jol=
t of 20,000 volts of pure physical electricity !!!!!.A million salutations =
to Narasimha ji and Manish ji for guiding so many Sadhakas on the path.


I=
 did not deserve the experience ...did not have any qualifications.Just wan=
ted to share the experience so that if anybody is close to San jose or visi=
ting they could take the opportunity to visit the shrine and experience it.=




Regards
