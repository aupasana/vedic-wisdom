and rituals, yoga, ayu=

Read the books by Dr Robert E=

will help you. Start with Aghora =
1

wealth of mat=

do-it-yourself =
homams are one of your outstanding contributions to
society, and shine brig=
htly among the other gems of your contributions.
I feel an inclination towa=
rds performing homams on a daily/weekly basis.
Before I start this, I want =
to seek your guidance on the following:
>
> 1. Do I need to prepare myself =
in any way before I start the homam?- I
will explain to you what I mean her=
e - since you have suggested that one
start with MahaGanapathi homam, I sha=
ll start with it too. However, as I
have been worshipping DeviMa every morn=
ing and Hanumanji every evening,
do I need to start worshipping MahaGanapat=
hi now for a few days during
mornings and evenings and then after a few day=
s, start with the homam?

Vipin ji, the energy that you are planning to wor=
ship is  no different
from the one that you already are worshiping. So don'=
t worry. When you
read the Atharva Sheersham, understand the meaning, that =
forms are
different , the energy is the same. The energy expresses itself
d=
ifferently with each form, but the source remains the same. Our mind
percei=
ves things as differently. It goes on tangents like "if i worship
this form=
, will the other one get offended?" All that is a convolution.
Just start t=
he homam.


> 2. Related to the first question, as I have been worshipping =
DeviMa
for quite sometime now, I see/visualize Her many times during the da=
y
(at work/home), so now when I start with the MahaGanapathi homam with
com=
plete faith, devotion, and surrender to MahaGanapathi, wouldn't there
be a =
conflict in my mind, since I may still be visualizing DeviMa
everywhere aro=
und me (due to mind's conditioning), while I am
worshipping MahaGanapathi a=
s the One who is the source, cradle and end
of everything, and hence shoule=
 be visualizing Him instead? This may be
a hypothetical situation, as I am =
talking about the future, however, may
still be relevant, and so I seek you=
r advice here.

Refer to the above reply.
Devi Ma is no different , Infact =
she will help you. Take Ganpathi ji as
one of her aspects and vice- a - ver=
sa and ask her to guide you, and she
will. If you sincerely surrender, your=
 questions will cease to exist
soon. Bete, devi ma aur ganeshi mein farak s=
irf tumhare dimaag mein
hain.
>
> 3. As I am householder, and we are expect=
ing our first child in the
next few months, is it ok to perform a homam at =
home? It may sound
jouvenile but I don't know any better, and would rather =
listen to wiser
men. The reason I ask this is that while doing the homam, w=
e chant
various mantras/stotras, and they produce effects in the immediate
=
environment, specially in the presence of Agni, the Pavaka. Although,
the g=
oal of my saadhana is to decondition my mimd to move towards
greater purity=
, humility and peace, and I have faith that a regular
homam will enable me =
to achieve that. However, for the sake of my wife
and our child (inside her=
 womb), I am prompted to ask this question.
Please don't take it in any oth=
er way except as a genuine concern for my
family (however silly it is)

In =
two words, I'll provide you the answer to that.

No Problem

> 4. Related t=
o the above question, if it is fine for me to do the homam
at home, then ca=
n my pregnant wife also participate in it, if she wants
to?

Yes, if she is=
 comfortable. You are not doing a ritual for destruction,
what harm can a l=
ittle worship bring?

> 5. Should I wait for an auspicious day like an amav=
asya or an eclipse
to start the homam, or is any day fine? Similarly, shoul=
d I do the homam
at a particular time every day or is any time fine? I do u=
nderstand that
doing the homam/any saadhana at the same time everyday, what=
ever time
one does it, is more beneficial than doing it at different times.=

  Just start, start today, start tomorrow, let eclipses handle
themselves,=
 you handle yourself. Forget what is beneficial, what will be
more profitab=
le and more gainful, just start, rest of the instructions
ganpathi ji will =
provide.

> 6. Is it better to do the homam at home or can it be done elsew=
here as
well? The reason I ask this is we are living in a rented accomodati=
on
and the smoke from the homam may blacken the walls and the ceiling.
Howe=
ver, in our residential/apartment complex, there is a common area,
which is=
 open on two sides, where some community festivals are
celebrated together,=
 and if I get the permission, then maybe I can do
the homam there? Is there=
 a strong reason/added benefit to doing the
homam at home?

If there is a b=
ackyard do it there, if there is a terrace do it there,
if you are doing it=
 in the house, do it near a window to help the smoke
along. Regarding your =
added benefit clause, are you doing a homam for
benefits or to celebrate/wo=
rship Ganpathi ji?
Forget maximum benefits, start with any benefit.

Oh yaar tu shuru toh kar, sawaal baad mein kariyo.

Yes indeed he and his Guru is, but like he would say forget=
 me and say
Devima zindabaad!!
