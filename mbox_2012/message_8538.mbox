Dear Narasimha,

Theoretically I understand what you mean, or rather I thin=
k I understand what you mean. I am in agreement with this way of looking at=
 Moksha, theoretically speaking.

In many of our Vedanta literature Moska i=
s said to be freedom from rebirth. That is what I can't agree to theoretica=
lly, at least at this moment. 


Is there any stopping from coming back? Th=
ere is an small but interesting incident in the Ramayana which illustrates =
what I was trying to say.


At the appointed hour, it was time for Rama to =
die. But the god of death 
could not enter Rama's city as Hanumana with his=
 yogic prowess guarded 
the gates of the city. Hanumana loved Rama so much =
that he did not want 
Rama to die. To distract Hanumana and let Nature take=
 its course, Rama 
dropped his ring through a crack in the floor and asked =
Hanumana to go 
and fetch it. The crack led Hanumana to the subterranean re=
alm where he 
found countless number of exactly similar looking rings. Vasu=
ki, the 
serpent-king, and guarding of the subterranean realm explained, 
"=
Whenever a ring falls here, a Hanumana follows it and we know it is 
time f=
or a Rama to leave his body. Such rings have fallen from above as 
long as =
I can remember, and will continue to do so in future. As long as the wheel =
of existence rotates, old worlds die and new ones are reborn. In each such =
world there will be a Hanumana, a Rama and a Rama's ring."

Dear Laxmi Narayan ji, 


Thank you for your email. I am doing fine=
 and I hope you are doing fine too. 

Disagreements and difference of view-=
points are absolutely fine, afterall in ancient India from the monotheists =
to the atheists, we had every breed coexisting. Having said that, I will ex=
plain a few of the points you have raised in your email, from my perspectiv=
e of course. 



<< You have to complete the story.>. 


The reason I canno=
t add anything more to it is because the individual himself did not reveal =
anything more about this.=C2=A0 For me, the incidents he revealed hold an i=
nteresting view-point and a value on its own . When I mention any such stor=

ting anything from it. Conclusions, whatever they maybe, have to be drawn b=
y every individual. Some may reject it, some may accept it, both of which a=
re fine. 


<< This story seems to like I used=C2=A0 to read in Chandamama.=
 This guy Iyengar seems to be a siddha if the=C2=A0 story so far is true.an=
d he has the ability to shape shift and transportation. So what?? But he st=
ill needs his daily fix of bhang.>> 

As per the Tantric scriptures, even L=
ord Shiva in his form of Bhairava smokes ganja, drinks alcohol, eats with d=
ogs and chandalas, roams around naked in the smashana. So is taking intoxic=
ants a sufficient criteria to judge anyone's spirituality? Not for me! 

, =


<<what does God mean in this tale? >> 


I will tell you how I see it. In=
 this story, God means infinity. Now what is infinity? It cannot be describ=
ed, it cannot be named, it cannot be understood using the five sense organs=
. Science does not understand infinity, art does not understand infinity, n=
othing or nobody=C2=A0 understands infinity. It is a summation of all that =
we know, all that we can=C2=A0 imagine and all that is impossible for us to=
 imagine. It is an incomprehensible force that runs through everything, fro=
m the most loveable to the most despicable , from the most holy to the most=
 unholy, from the greatest saint to the stupidest piece of rock at the bott=
om of the deepest ocean in the farthest planet in the farthest solar system=
 in the farthest universe. 



Now question is, can an average human being =
"know" this mysterious and all pervading force? Knowing implies understandi=
ng. Clearly no. Then how does one interact with such a thing? One way is to=
 consider everything, and I mean EVERYTHING from living to non-living, as a=
 manifestation of that force and thus learn to love the same unconditionall=
y without expecting anything in return. No wonder such unconditional love i=
s not easy. It needs tremendous effort to change our own conditioning of th=
e mind, and work on our inherent biases and prejudices. That is what the=C2=
=A0 aim of sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself, to make one ready to=
 be able to unconditionally love everything. The greater number of entities=
 one can love unconditionally, that much little bit closer one can come to =
interacting with the truly infinite. And those few rare human beings who ca=
n love a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly the closest to this s=
upreme and unknowable force.
 In common language, we call them Rishis. 

I =
like all forms of Deities, for I find something beautiful in everyone of th=
em. And I also like the One behind forms, which is so perfectly transcenden=
tal that it cannot be comprehended ever. It's like the surface area of the =
fine tip of a needle, or the gap between the two breaths, or the millionth =
part of a single hair, or the endless-ness of space, or the bottomless well=
 of stillness in the mind at certain points in meditation. The only thing t=
hat stops me from getting a better understanding the grandeur of=C2=A0 this=
 formless entity are the limitations of my own mind and body, that I have a=
cquired over millions of births. That is why Sadhana. To slowly gnaw away a=
t my own mind, to be better able to appreciate this endless, nameless entit=
y. G_d. 


I do not believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirth? If the U=
niverse itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama and Krshna come ba=
ck at every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not get born? Infact, w=
hen a person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they merely go to an=
other plane in this Universe and stay there for eons of time, since time an=
yway moves very, very slowly in different realms. But then, if this force s=
o wants, it can send back any of the souls from any of the realms to any of=
 the other realms to serve a certain function. And if a soul stays in a cer=
tain higher realm and in forced to take rebirth again, the seeds of the kar=
mas - which never really die off - are=C2=A0 watered again by the environme=
nt of birth and they sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyond one =
cycle of creation. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very same ene=
mies that they had been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Mahabharata=
 says
 so. I believe it. 



What then is the final aim of all this, spirit=
uality etc? I don't know. Maybe, to teach us to broaden our perspectives an=
d consequentially lessen our attachments to our otherwise mundane lives and=
 its mundane problems. This is like a circular roller-coaster ride we see i=
n local melas. Tighten the seat-belts, bring a smile in the heart, be detac=
hed and enjoy the show! 


Best of luck and take good care of yourself!

=C2=A0 Dear Rajarshi Bhai,=
 
How are you? You have to complete the story. you have to tell what happen=
ed when X went to meet this man in temple.or anything else which happened. =
It is like somebody gone in kitchen to get rest of meal and not come back. =



First I have to thank you for writing that story about Divine Mother Sri=
 Chinnmastaji. I had developed a fear about Her but 3 times I got spiritual=
 indications over the period of 2 months that I should write my story. When=
 you wrote back suddenly my fear about Her melted away and I did immediate =
prayers to Her. Thanks. 


The other thing is can I dare to say that I do n=
ot agree what is in this thread. Why does this so called spiritual man has =
to dump his failure on=C2=A0 religion. If people do not believe in religion=
 or God or afterlife, it is their problem. We are not all equal. We all do =
not come from same stock. We are born with different conditions, go through=
 different life experiences and go where our fate or destiny takes us. This=
 world is composed of 3 gunas and there is always going to tension of diffe=
rent sort. Why=C2=A0 blame it on religion or God, why not on greed and desi=
re to control others and lord over them using what ever mean. 


This story=
 seems to like I used to read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a=
 siddha if the story so far is true.and he has the ability to shape shift a=
nd transportation. So what?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang. 


=
what does God mean in this tale? Is it Creator God or Divine Lord Of Sri Vr=
indavan or=C2=A0=C2=A0 Divine=C2=A0 Mother or=C2=A0 Self Realisation or Uni=
versal God or Jewish God or Formless God or Fire God?? After all there was =
a dhoni fire there? Or some other God ?? 


Sri Vrindavan has a rolling pop=
ulation. They are not in confusion. Many people come there only for curiosi=
ty, many other come only for Darshan in the Temple and go back home happy. =
many others come with different desires. It is very wrong to expect from a =
person who is in fifth grade to have knowledge of 15th grade. 


Many times=
 people go to temple to pray and ask for certain things and if it does not =
happen they become very anti religion and anti God. So what?? It has nothin=
g to do with me or you or anybody else. It is their life. 


I was very ver=
y very ill. Nobody was helping me. Many people were giving me lot of pain.=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 I went=C2=A0 from Religious place to religious place, temple t=
o temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing seem to worked. Then I took up reli=
gious practise of doing mantra japa and other things which are in scripture=
s and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It is totally religious discipline =
according to our scriptures. 


Do you drive a car? Did you pass you exam f=
irst time? I do not drive a car. It will take me several exams to pass it. =
Many people pass their test first time and drive successfully. Does it mean=
 I should blame car or exams or examiner or road for my failure??? .Many pe=

I also used to think that a real experience of God=

someone is totally=C2=A0 dependent on Divine Mother and calls on Her day an=
d night, but yet he is not ready for certain energy or his body is not clea=

Dear Ajit, 


I am in complete agreement with your th=
oughts.=C2=A0 A spiritual man once said, "Religion has been created to shie=
ld people from God".=C2=A0 


When I first heard this I was not convinced a=
nd thought it was some fake secularism. Lately I realized this is literally=
 true. Heavy psychological constructs are created by religions to protect a=
n average person from the real experience of God, which is so powerful and =
overwhelming that if and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurric=
ane in your average life and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans. =




I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident. 



An individu=
al - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to=C2=A0 stay there for some=C2=A0 years=
. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, wh=
en a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and asks=
 for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered =
someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pran=
am to the man and said, "Maharaj, please tell us some words of God". The ma=
n became angry, and retorted back, "Why? Why waste time talking of God, no =
one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run away. So please continue w=
ith your lectures as you were doing before I came in". Everyone became unco=
mfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sw=
eet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and started walkin=
g off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his follow=
ers and said, "He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a
 while, but h=
e has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking too much=C2=A0 ganja"=
. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt attracted to tha=
t ragged man and went out to see where the guy was going. As he approached =
the ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear Engli=
sh, "Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me." X was of course tak=
en aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and more over he had n=
o clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X was dressed in the g=
arb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). 



The man continued, "My name is Mr Iy=
engar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by profession, but left hom=
e long back and have been a wondering sadhu since then." X asked him, why d=
id you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, "All=
 this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is source of all confusion. =
No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no =
one. And God is the reason for all=C2=A0 the religious troubles and other n=
onsense." X felt a little irritated, "Why do you have so much bitterness ab=
out religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu for long, then how co=
me you haven't met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?". Mr Iye=
ngar replied, "Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine ma=
n here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, merely different degrees =
of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not accessible to others.=
" Mr Iyengar continued, "The root of
 all this problem is this God business=
. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is b=
eyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best a man will onl=
y imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-powers. If the in=
dividual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this form by a project=
ion of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abilities from th=
is form, and generally be regarded=C2=A0 by others as a man of god. But God=
 is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem is trying to und=
erstand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing that one has und=
erstood correctly." While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall a=
nd bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chillum. Then held t=
he smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in sm=
all bits. Then he continued, "You (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear=
 mind in your head, don't get
 confused by all these show of spirituality y=
ou see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mistake=
s in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young man in the localit=
y of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having nothing better to do,=
 I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God reall=
y is and how to interact with this thing." As he spoke he reached a two sto=
ried house, and a man, woman and a=C2=A0 young girl came out of the house. =
They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too come insid=
e, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay at their h=
ouse. I will show you something interesting if you join me. 



After an ho=
ur inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was =
bringing different fruits and sweets for their food while the young girl wa=
s massaging Mr Iyengar's feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospita=
lity. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has=
 no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a householder and=
 enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw tha=
t the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded hands w=
ere bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitt=
ing on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turned round =
to see=C2=A0 what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in shock=
. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on=
 the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin wa=
s dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up
 the whole =
room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with ench=
antingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being any more but a god sit=
ting in place of what was even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-lookin=
g Mr Iyengar. 



X did not know what was happening. He saw the young man g=
estured towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotize=
d, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lo=
st all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a re=
mote location with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, =
held his hand and took him inside the temple precincts.=C2=A0 There he saw =
a dhuni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation wi=
th ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that m=
editating man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I w=
as talking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one=
 in Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After provid=
ing directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X ag=
ain and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapse=
d into
 unconsciousness again. 



When X woke up, he was in the room in th=
at house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged se=
lf, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as=
 directed.

=C2=A0 Dear Prasanth, 


> To those who s=
ay that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion 




In general, many of=
 those who don't believe in religion or God are being more honest than thos=
e who do. After all, most people who believe in God look at him as a limite=
d being to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions are most apparent=
 when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formalize=
 these biases. 


While being mired in this word of duality, we think that =
an ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of "paapa" that we e=
ngage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder tha=
t others look at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept o=
f God. We "God believers" are the culprit. 


We all have plenty of paapa a=
nd punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be s=
teadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn "paapa" and=
 leave the "punya" intact. It is us "God believers" who look at our lives, =
ignoring all the "paapa phala". We look at one or two instances of "punya p=
hala" and declare our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial obser=
ver sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We "God believers" are the cu=
lprit. 


For the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spi=
ritual practices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds=
 and minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and t=
ime really flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakt=
i and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for w=
hat it is, and laughs at us. We "God believers" are the culprit. 


The bes=
t way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the "non-believe=
rs" and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack=
 of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, th=
e world will be served. 


If we see God as the limitless power that he is,=
 he is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture him within a religio=
n. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of u=
s to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. Un=
fortunately, most religions ask us to accept them without question. They as=
k us to place our heads on them with reverence, and try to prevent the spir=
itually advanced from going any farther.

 is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, n=
ot ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all  the r=
eligious troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little irritated, "Why do y=

a sadhu for long, then how come you haven't met a single genuine sadhu yet,=
 how is it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take
 Vrindavan alone=
, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody e=
lse, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, h=
e is not accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The root of all this=
 problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know Go=
d ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to compr=
ehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman=
 with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will =
create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire s=
upernatural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded  by ot=
hers as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of=
 the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and th=

topped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja,
 and in one pull finishe=
d off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, sl=
