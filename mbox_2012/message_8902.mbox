Dear Ranga,

One of the primary factors is by focusing a bit on pronunciati=
on as well. (Some say leave it to God. But we do have to put our effort to =
get correct pronunciation. God helps thos who help themselves)

Rendering o=
f Vishnu Sahasra Nama by Challakere Brothers sounds very right. You can get=
 it here

http://www.kannadaaudio.com/Songs/Devotional/home/MantraroopiMaha=
Vishnu-ChallakereBrothers.php

Also the idea of any Sahasra nama/ashtottara=
 shatanama is to ruminate over the qualities of Vishnu thus creating a flow=
ing meditation of attributes of that deity. For that to happen, one has to =
be able to recite from memory effortlessly. Needless to say this generally =
takes quite long time. But one has to start somewhere. Isnt it?

Regards,
S=
rikanth
