I find a lot of references made to mantra shastra in jyotisha classes/texts
at a lot of places. I thought it was a book and searched for it a little -
but could not find one.

Is it a general name of science of or study of mantras or is it a book? or
is it part of some book/veda?
What is a good resource for studying Mantra Shastra?
