*Watch Upanishad Ganga, EVERY SUNDAY 10AM on DD NATIONAL, 11th MARCH ONWARD=
S
*

Upanishad Ganga is not merely a television serial, it is a window that=

offers a
 glimpse of the ancient culture and value system of India. India =
is not
just a
geographical entity, it signifies an entire vision of life wh=
ich is an art
as well as a
science of living.

This is a vision that shows =
a single Consciousness that weaves through every
particle of the universe, =
that knits together man and man, man and animal,
man and
his world and all =
that is beyond. This is a vision that our ancient seers
called
=93Atman=94 =
or the =93Self=94.

What is that, knowing which nothing else remains to be =
known? Was it just
the
imagination of the ancient seers and thinkers? What =
was the Truth revealed
by the
experiments of adepts in the science of life?=
 What exactly is this vision
of the =93Self=94,
the knowledge of the =93Sel=
f=94?

What is that eternal Truth which is the foundation of the art of lif=
e, the
science of life
that flourishes in India? What is that Truth which i=
s beyond time, which is
universal,
which is the very basis of all time and =
place?

It is this Truth that is explained in Vedanta -- in the Upanishads.=
 They
talk about that
which sustains this life and this universe, and that =
which is beyond it.

>From time to time great seers and thinkers have procla=
imed it in different
ways,
from King Janaka and Rishi Yajnavalkya in the da=
ys of yore to Adi
Sankaracharya,
Sayanacharya and Madhvacharya, and Swami V=
ivekananda and Swami
Chinmayananda in the present times.

Time flowed and s=
o did the flow of knowledge. Geographical frontiers
changed,
history change=
d, communities changed, literature changed, words changed and
their
meaning=
s changed, but the immutable Truth remained the same, though many
kinds
of =
veils covered it.

After independence, India developed as a nation, with ma=
ny new revolutionary
ideas and slogans that spurred its material growth, bu=
t dimmed the glory of
its
ancient spiritual heritage. The art and science o=
f life that gave it its
unique identity
was bundled and moved out of the re=
gular stream of school and college
education,
and even declared to be irrel=
evant by some.

Chinmaya Mission entered the picture to enable the flow of =
spiritual
knowledge to
continue unhindered, so that it could irrigate and n=
ourish our day to day
lives.
Unfortunately, today this knowledge is conside=
red outdated and unwanted.

However, can the longing for Truth ever be supp=
ressed? Can the experience of
humanity for thousands of years, their untiri=
ng quest for Truth be denied?
