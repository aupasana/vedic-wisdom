I would like to perform a simple homam at home. I do not have the time to d=
o any kind of elaborate homam at home due to work commitments, and because =
I already spend a total 1 hour a day on japa (I do not want to reduce the j=
apa). I would like to do a really simple homam procedure that takes no more=
 than 10-15 minutes- I would do this after half an hour of my japa practice=
.  

In the Vedic wisdom article online, Narasimhaji says that even lightin=
g a clay pot with some sticks and uttering mantras for a few minutes with g=
enuine devotion will produce results. 
With this in mind, I have adapted Na=
rasimhaji's homam article to create a 10 minute Lakshmi Narayana homam proc=
edure for myself and wanted to check if this is okay.

Light havan fire and=
 then,

1. Worship Ganesha and pray for removal of any obstacles and forgiv=
eness for any mistakes committed during this homam

2. Worship Agni, and re=
quest him to taking my offerings to Lakshmi and Narayana in a pure form 

3=
. Worship the Divine Mother in the form of Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati and=
 ask for guidance in performing this homam, and for forgiveness for any mis=
takes. 

4. Worship my Guru Swami Sivananda Saraswati of Rishikesh and ask =
for guidance in performing this homam.

5. Repeat mantras Om Shri MahaLaksh=
myai Namaha. Svaha. and Om Namo Narayanaya. Swaha. as many times as I can i=
n the ten minutes with devotion, and offering ghee while saying Swaha. Grea=
ter proportion of homam time is spent on this.

6. Thank Ganesh and Agni. T=
hank Lakshmi and Narayana. Offer prayer that this homam may be for the welf=
are of all beings. 

I know this is a much abbrieviated homam version but i=
t would be the best I can do at present. 

Does this sound alright? Please =
could Narasimhaji comment.

Thanks. 

Aparna
