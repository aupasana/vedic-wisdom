Namaste,

Is there any short procedure like Ganapati Homam for Satyanarayan=
 Puja which can be used to do the puja on regular basis without help of a p=
riest (it's difficult to get appointment with priests)? 

In Satyanarayan p=
uja katha it's mentioned that this puja should be done at the temple or any=
 'pavitra' place. Is it ok to do it at residence ? 

Regards
Aparna
