Hello, 

Tough times dont last, tough people do. so buck up my friend. 

Le=
ave aside all worries especially when sitting for puja. Simply focus on gen=
erating all the sincerity/love/devotion that you "can". What you can sincer=
ely generate is the only thing that matters. so dotn worry about what you c=
ant. 

Increase the time/intensity of whatever puja you are doing. besides =
this do take all the action needed to solve your problem, knowing that you =
are taken care of by your diety. 

There are 2 words "shraddha n saburi" - =
"faith n patience"

In case you are not doing homam, please start with gana=
pati or any one you like. 

Regards.
