Dear Ranga,

Thank you so much for your kind explanation in detail and I wi=
ll start performing homam as soon as possible. I will need to purchase all =
the needed items and start Maha Ganapathy homam as suggested on the website=
.


Regards,
Murlai

Dear Murali

I had the same question a few months ago when I =
started to get interested in performing homam at home. But now I perform th=
e homam regularly exactly as descried in the manual by Mr PVR Narasimha Rao=
. 

My homa kundam is around 8 inches (each side) and I use dried coconut p=
ieces (flakes about an inch long are better, you can simply cut the dried c=
oconut halves with a simple knife to get these flakes) as offering. For the=
 first time I have used gomay with ghee on each piece. These also cause NO =
smoke, nor any unpleasant odor after the ceremony).

I control the fire wit=
h the amount of dried coconut and ghee I offer in the fire. When the fire i=
s subsiding I add a little piece of camphor (karpuram), some dried coconut =
powder and a drop of ghee. Dropping the ghee directly on the flame seems to=
 dampen it a little. Adding a drop just to side of the fire seems to help s=
pread it. Best way is to try and learn. 

In summary, it seems just fine to=
 do the homam in an apartment or other such closed spaces.

I hope this hel=
ps. Do not wait, start doing it.
