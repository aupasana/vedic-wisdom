Namo Ramana
here i remember an old story. One day Bhagavan Narada Maharshi =
went to Lord
Narayana and told him that he was the only one who remembers h=
is name all
the time as he used to chant his name without stop. So Narayana=
 told him
that if it was true that Narada remembers him all the time then N=
arada
should go around the world with a cup full of oil once without spilli=
ng
even a drop on the ground. Narada accepted the challenge and went round =
the
world without spilling the oil and approched Lord Narayana and told him=

that he had accomplished the task and so he proved that he was the true
de=
votee etc. Lord Narayan asked him that how many times he chanted Lord's
nam=
e during the course and then only it struck to Narada that not once he
coul=
d chant HIS name during the round trip and his concentration was on oil
onl=
y. Then Lord Narayana showed him one business man who wakes up early in
the=
 morning and chant HIS name thrice before starting his daily routine and
be=
fore going to bed he chants HIS name thrice daily. Not a single day the
bus=
inees man forgot this task and Narada and Lord watched this for many
days a=
nd months. Then Lord tolsd Narada that the business man with his so
much or=
deal remembers HIM twice daily at a particular moment and that is
the great=
est Bhakthi of all. So Narada understood the morale of the story
and I beli=
eve You also understood the same. "Every time on time"

I wanted PRA=

<br>
This article came up. It's very i=

<br>

god-at-all-times</a><br>

<br>
The author, Sadhak Gaurav, says:<br>
<br>
&q=
uot;While doing duties, one is supposed to remember God. There can be three=
 ways to achieve such remembrance:<br>
 <br>
1) While remembering God, do t=
he work. (Here remembrance is foremost and work is secondary.)<br>
<br>
2) =
While doing work, remember God. (Here work is foremost and remembrance is s=
econdary.)<br>
<br>
3) Only do God's work. (Here exclusive feelings tow=
ards God are primary.)<br>
<br>
Most of the people try to follow #1 and #2.=
 Some people do minimal amount of duties and make remembrance their prime f=
ocus.    <br>
Some other people try to do their duties and take care of the=
ir family and friends and try to remember God while doing their duties. Mos=
t of these people struggle to remember God and tend to forget him. One obvi=
ous reason is the lack of alertness. But they also make very grave mistake.=
 They accept their body, family, work and business as their own and have fe=
eling on mine-ness towards it. <br>

<br>
"Therefore, God is forgotten=
 again and again and it is difficult to remember Him."<br>
<br>
"=
If one does only God's work, then God will always be remembered. There =
is sense of mine-ness towards God and His work and therefore, remembrance h=
appens all the time. Therefore, one should have a firm resolve to do only G=
od's work so that one can always remember Him."<br>

<br>
"Wh=
at is God's work? In order to do God's work, one must accept and un=
derstand the truth. The truth is that everything  belongs to God. All livin=
g entities are part of God as God is in everyone. All activities done are G=
od's work as God is everyone."<br>

<br>
I thought he explained th=
e technique brilliantly. God bless him! It's easy to say "remember=
 God", but it's much more helpful when someone gives PRACTICAL adv=
ice on how to! <br>
<br>
How does one remember God all day? While brushing =
one's teeth? While driving? While at work? When someone's yelling a=
t one? When someone's being nice to one?  <br>
<br>
Sivananda said, No =
need to run away to the forest if you're a busy man/woman of the world.=
 You can attain God in and through the world. Every hour, spend 2 minutes c=
ontemplating God. <br>
"Every hour, on the hour" (like the BBC wo=
rld news slogan!), contemplate God and say the Name...Over time, this build=
s up a huge spiritual force that will transform you...<br>
