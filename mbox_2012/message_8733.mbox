Dear Rajarshi,

A sage "sms" indeed! Yes direction must be always, always t=
he top most priority. It reminded me of simple, yet quite effective day to =
day example of driving Car. One can not miss/ignore the sight of correct ro=
ad to the destination even for a split second. However, Optimised "controll=
ed" speed (even if very fast by set standards) could be an added advantage =
while not loosing the sight of the road.

Best Regards,

Utpal
