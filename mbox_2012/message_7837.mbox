Jaya Sree Rama

Namaste,
=A0
I am cc'ing this mail to a few yahoogroups wit=
hout revealing your identity.
=A0
<Can predictions of life/chart be changed=
 by prayer?=A0
Is chart be all and end all or can God change all in blink o=
f eye?>

=A0
Horoscope shows the destiny. Destiny is the summation of all a=
ctions performed by one's free will until the birth (i.e. in all previous l=
ives). Actions of one's free will are added on top of those actions. What o=
ne experiences right now is a result of all the actions done until now, inc=
luding those done since birth, i.e. in this life.
=A0
Thus, actions of free=
 will CAN modify what is shown in the horoscope. God, of course, has many d=
efinitions. One definition is that God is an abstraction of the Natural Ord=
er of this universe that gives equal and opposite results to all the action=
s of one's free will. Thus, yes, God CAN change what horoscope shows, if ac=
tions to change the indications of the destiny reflected in horoscope were =
engaged in, since birth.
=A0
Whether it can happen in "blink of eye" or tak=
es days or months or years depends on the weight of previous karmas and the=
 intensity of the current actions that free will is able to engage in! Plea=
se note that free will is often constrained by the destiny and not entirely=
 free. But Prayer/meditation/homam creates a mental state that is conducive=
 to engaging in the most correct and perfect actions within one's current s=
ituation and constraints.
=A0
If you have a cup of milk, it takes one spoon=
 of sugar to sweeten it. If you have 10 gallons of milk, it takes a lot mor=
e sugar to sweeten it. The effort and prayers required to overcome destiny =
should be commensurate with the intensity of destiny.
=A0
Hope that helps.

Best regards,
Narasimha
