Namaste PVR Ji, 

Its a really nice fact that you champion the things for w=
hich you have seen the results firsthand. its really commendable. 

Would d=
efinitely like to read some of your experiences and insights about Satayana=
rayan puja. 

About Naryana i heard form one accomplished tantra sadhak tha=
t reaching satyanarayan is not easy. The process requires lifetimes and the=
 path itself is very less understood. Infact only the vedic worship form re=
mains and tantra texts are lost.

regards
priyank
