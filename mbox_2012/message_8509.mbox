At the University of Exeter we are developing a new and brief measure to ev=
aluate change through Mindfulness Meditation-Based approaches, and seek exp=
erienced meditators to complete two questionnaires online. This study was a=
pproved by the University of Exeter Ethics Committee and involves exploring=
 how people who meditate deal with emotions. It should take no longer than =
15 minutes. The study is for people who meditate, and can be accessed onlin=
e via the following link:

ple-regulate-their-emotions-meditators

If you have any questions about the=
 study, or would prefer to receive a paper copy of the questionnaires along=
 with a freepost return envelope, please contact Matthew Williams on mjw230=

Thank you for reading and considering this.
