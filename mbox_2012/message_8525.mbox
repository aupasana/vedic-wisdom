Dear Ajit,

I am in complete agreement with your thoughts.=C2=A0 A spiritua=
l man once said, "Religion has been created to shield people from God".=C2=
=A0

When I first heard this I was not convinced and thought it was some fa=
ke secularism. Lately I realized this is literally true. Heavy psychologica=
l constructs are created by religions to protect an average person from the=
 real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if and =
when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in your average life =
and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.


I will briefly narrate =
a true and interesting incident. 


An individual - say X - had gone to Vri=
ndavan to stay there for some years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famou=
s sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing u=
nblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing a=
t the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the rag=
ged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, "Maharaj, please=
 tell us some words of God". The man became angry, and retorted back, "Why?=
 Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all =
will run away. So please continue with your lectures as you were doing befo=
re I came in". Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile=
 the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky=
 and then got up and started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who =
was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, "He is a sadhu who comes t=
o Vrindavan once in a while,
 but he has probably lost his mental balance d=
ue to smoking too much ganja". Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird=
 reason felt attracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy=
 was going. As he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around =
and spoke to X in clear English, "Hello, I was waiting for you to come and =
join me." X was of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in E=
nglish and more over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew En=
glish (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). 


The man =
continued, "My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer=
 by profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu sin=
ce then." X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsa=
ng? Mr Iyengar replied, "All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself =
is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, no=
t ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all the religiou=
s troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little irritated, "Why do you have=
 so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu=
 for long, then how come you haven't met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is=
 it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there =
is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, mer=
ely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not=
 accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The root of
 all this proble=
m is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever.=
 What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. =
At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with s=
uper-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create =
this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernat=
ural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded by others as a man=
 of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem =
is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing =
that one has understood correctly." While talking, the sadhu stopped at a s=
mall tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chil=
lum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing=
 the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, "You (meaning X) are a young m=
an. Have a clear mind in your head, don't get
 confused by all these show o=
f spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of =
terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young ma=
n in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having nothi=
ng better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realize=
d what God really is and how to interact with this thing." As he spoke he r=
eached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a young girl came out of t=
he house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too =
come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay =
at their house. I will show you something interesting if you join me.


Aft=
er an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The wo=
man was bringing different fruits and sweets for their food while the young=
 girl was massaging Mr Iyengar's feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the=
 hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else=
 but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a househo=
lder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he=
 saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded=
 hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X =
was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turne=
d round to see what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in sho=
ck. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat =
on the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin =
was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up the
 whol=
e room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with en=
chantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being any more but a god s=
itting in place of what was even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-look=
ing Mr Iyengar.


X did not know what was happening. He saw the young man g=
estured towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotize=
d, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lo=
st all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a re=
mote location with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, =
held his hand and took him inside the temple precincts. There he saw a dhun=
i burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash=
 all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that meditat=
ing man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was tal=
king about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vr=
indavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After providing di=
rections of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again an=
d immediately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into=

 unconsciousness again. 


When X woke up, he was in the room in that hous=
e, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, wit=
h a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as direct=
ed.

Dear Prasanth,

> To those who say that they don=E2=80=99=
t believe in any religion




In general, many of those who don't believe i=
n religion or God are being more honest than those who do. After all, most =
people who believe in God look at him as a limited being to barter with. Al=
l of our biases and assumptions are most apparent when dealing with our God=
s. Often, religion has simply served to formalize these biases.

While bein=
g mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of insincere prayer=
 can undo the whole weight of "paapa" that we engage in throughout the day.=
 And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others look at all the suf=
fering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We "God believers" ar=
e the culprit.

We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipelin=
e. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both ki=
nds of fruits, we ask God to burn "paapa" and leave the "punya" intact. It =
is us "God believers" who look at our lives, ignoring all the "paapa phala"=
. We look at one or two instances of "punya phala" and declare our prayers =
to be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, an=
d laughs at us. We "God believers" are the culprit.

For the most part, our=
 bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is =
particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When engaged in wo=
rldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And yet, we ex=
pect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly =
bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We =
"God believers" are the culprit.

The best way to bring about new waves of =
bhakti is not to look at the "non-believers" and try to convert them. All w=
e have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be honest with our=
selves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be served.

If we see=
 God as the limitless power that he is, he is difficult to define. It is di=
fficult to capture him within a religion. Religion should see itself as a s=
tepping-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on =
top of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us t=
o accept them without question. They ask us to place our heads on them with=
 reverence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced from going any fart=
her.

sasneham,
