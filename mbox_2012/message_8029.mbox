Dear Narasimhaji,

Recently I was introduced to Soundarya Lahari chanting a=
nd meditation during a satsang. Swamiji was saying about the immense materi=
al benefits that could be reaped by mantra japa of each sloka. 

Have you t=
ried chanting Soundarya Lahari any point of time? what is your view?

I use=
d to visit a temple last year and the priest advised me to chant Lalitha sa=
hasranamam during the Navaratri days. In his opinion, LS was giving benefit=
s faster than chandi path/ Devi Mahatmyam. 

I had chanted Devi Mahatmyam f=
ew years ago on few occasions. I had some trouble at that time and all that=
 trouble vanished quietly. Whatever happened, it happened for good. 

I wou=
ld be thankful if you can advise about all the three sloka.

Thanks and reg=
ards
