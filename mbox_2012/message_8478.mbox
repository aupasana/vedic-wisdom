Hi, 
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 So how are you doing? no body answered your letter alt=
hough many are married, I suppose. I am not but I thought I will write seve=
ral things after some time. But things are changing in my life and so as I =
was getting to write it without delay,=A0I saw a tv programme about pregnan=
t women in India. And then I received a indication that I should not get in=
volved in=A0such things. Certain things should=A0remain hidden. So I will w=
rite a very short true story only.
=A0
I had read that drinking coconut mil=
k during pregnancy results in baby having a white skin.
=A0
My late Uncle w=
as famous astrologer in his time and he was also my spiritual Guru. Somehow=
 he had very fair white complexion and so his children=A0. In late 50's or =
early 60's he was travelling by first class in train. After some time he no=
ticed a woman was kept staring at him.
This made him uneasy but then that w=
oman started to speak to him. Do you have daughters? she asked. My uncle sa=
id yes. Do they have same white skin as yourself. Again my uncle said yes. =
Are they of marriage age. The answer was yes again. Would you give them in =
marriage to my son because their union will give my grandchildren as white =
skin as you have.
=A0
Now my Uncle asked that woman her caste. As soon she =
told
=A0her caste which was very different,=A0my uncle politely refused her=
 offer.
=A0
So if you are of different caste it is better to stick to cocon=
ut milk.lol
=A0
And good luck for your Purashcharan of whichever Mantra you=
 do. Remember to give sweets to your supporters after you finish it. I like=
 white rasgulla and white dosa as well.
=A0
Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Garbhadhan Sanskar

dear narasimha ji and my spir=
itual siblings,

i am planning to come up with a book on planning babies.
o=
f course the market is flooded with books on this topic
but this one will b=
e more from the point of view of Vedas
and local/regional folk knowledge.
s=
o i'd be really grateful if you could all pitch in
with your own knowledge =
base.
every bit is welcome- links, articles,your own knowledge
anything tha=
t you must have heard from the last generation or anyone, interesting facts=
, secrets etc. 

i am especially interested to know the following:

1. Veda=
s and other ancient sacred texts- Garbhdhan sanskar, garbhadhan havan/pooja=
, planning to have a baby girl/boy etc.
2. mythological tales proving the e=
fficacy of the above
3. local/regional knowledge- which food are good for p=
regnant ladies,
taboo foods and acts; vrata/pooja etc.; good food and lifes=
tyle specicfic to post partum days etc.
4. recipes that have specific effec=
ts viz. in Mithila region of Bihar preg ladies take "banslochan" to make th=
e bones of the baby strong.
then they eat jeera ka halwa after the baby is =
born which heals the mother and enhances the milk formation in her breasts
=
5. the speciifc types of massages, asanas etc. for ladies
6. taking care of=
 the young ones as prevalent in your own home areas
7. annprasahan and othe=
r poojas done in your areas for the baies
8. jyotish aspect- as in which na=
kshatras are favourable and which ones will produce babies with which quali=
ties
9. which months will have babies with which qualities etc.
10.any othe=
r aspects that you feel must be included in the book.

it'll be a coffee ta=
ble book with lots of snippets.
so every bit of your knowledge is welcome.
=
and of course you'll get credits for your contribution :)

please help me w=
ith this.

thanks and regards,
dolly.
