Then why even trust such priest/ astrologer. I think the question here 
is NOT about procedure, rather credibility of the astrologers. Would you 
do pariharam as he prescribed!

One of the important things I heard recently from pravachan's was DO NOT 
emulate great souls. Probably 99% of us are not capable of seeing GOD 
every where. There were souls that could live seeing GOD in everything. 
For example, we can not emulate Bhagavan Ramana. However this statement 
"GOD is every where" is a good target for us to reach, it takes a one in 
a million soul to live that way.

I do not mean to offend/ undermine anyone's maturity here, however it is 
dangerous to emulate great souls.
