Dear Narasimha,

<<Don't define moksha in terms of rebirth.>>

Understood. =



But then there seems to be the standard idea prevalent, that Upanishadic=
 idea of Moksha, that there is no more rebirths. While Vedantins believe th=
at they enter place of sat-chit-ananda, while dualists believe they enter a=
 place or loka of the deity and are free from being born.=C2=A0 


Another =
logic question comes up. When a being is really free from any wants, and ha=
s to take birth again (since as you said what happens after Moksha is not f=
ixed), then the being may again have to strive for moksha, since by birth a=
 veil of ignorance is placed on the mind?

I will wait for your other email=
 about the verse. Maybe it is trying to say that the truth of reality is hi=
dden under brilliant illusions (golden lid), and therefore asking for the r=
emoval of those illusions for a clear "vision" (realization) of the Truth. =



-Regards

Namaste Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
One more point to =
ponder:
=C2=A0
If a ripple in the ocean mistakenly thinks it is a "ripple" =
and separate from the ocean, doesn't its "liberation" imply a full realizat=
ion that it is the ocean? If so, what is the meaning of "no re-birth"?
=C2=

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
After all, many ripples arise in the ocean from=
 time to time, get transformed into various shapes from time to time, and d=
ie down at some point of time. If one ripple permanently and fully realizes=
 that it is the ocean, it does not mean the ripple ceases to exist or cease=
s to change. It means that it sees the entire ocean and all ripples in it a=
s Itself.
=C2=A0
Similarly, many beings arise in Self from time to time, ge=
t reborn in various bodies from time to time, and stop being re-born at som=
e point of time. If one being permanently and fully realizes that it is the=
 Self, it does not mean the being should not be born again. It means that t=
he being sees the Self and all beings in Self as Itself.

=A0 *
=C2=A0
Self-realization or moksha is not easy to understand. It is of=
ten seen through the prism of one's conditioning, as I explained below.
=C2=
=A0
You (Rajarshi) asked me on Twitter about the meaning of verse 15 of Ish=
avasyopanishad (aka Ishopanishad) - "hiraNamayena pAtreNa satyasyApihitaM m=
ukhaM tattvaM pUShannapAvR^iNu satyadharmAya dR^iShTaye". I will try to rep=
ly soon in detail. This is one Upanishad where I am not too pleased with an=
y existing commentary. 
=C2=A0
Anyway, that particular verse needs to be un=
derstood in the context of the verses before it. Interestingly, those verse=
s touch upon some things we are discussing above and below! For example, on=
e verse says that those who pursue no re-birth and non-existence reach a "d=
ark region" (i.e. not the effulgent light of Self), though those who are in=
terested in a nice re-birth reach even darker regions.
=C2=A0

*
=C2=A0
Moksha or liberation is lack of ANY wants. Though *wanting* a nice=
 existence (e.g. healthy body, intelligent mind, wealthy environment etc) i=
s a bondage, so is *wanting* a non-existence or no re-birth, i.e. fear or a=
version for rebirth. Wanting not to be reborn is a want too! When the true =
light of Self shines unblocked in one, one does not view either death or de=
athlessness or birth or birthlessness as better or worse.
=C2=A0
When one h=
as no wants, one is liberated. What happens to such a being is not fixed an=
d not useful to discuss. It just depends on the momentum of previous wants =
before wants disappeared.
=C2=A0
Don't define moksha in terms of rebirth.

=C2=A0 Dear Rajarshi, 


I had to re-read this a few times, b=
ut I think I'm finally understanding what you are trying to convey. Thanks =
for explaining.=C2=A0 


As Narasimha mentioned, moksha and bandha are irre=
vocably linked. The 'status' of the world is right in the middle of the two=
. We are all looking at this from different points of view, based on our ow=
n conditioning. 


I can't pull myself out of the dream analogy. All of us =
dream. We are creators of the dream world, and it is our consciousness alon=
e that forms the material for the dream world. Once created, a portion of o=
urselves gets projected into the dream world, and we become subject to our =
own maya. We interact with so many other created beings, and interact based=
 on the rules of this dream world. Inside the dream world, for the duration=
 of it's existence, everything appears true.=C2=A0 


The world that is cre=
ated is based on the thoughts that went through our mind at the moment we f=
ell into deep sleep. At some point, once we have experienced enough, we nat=
urally wake up. We spend some time in the "real world", and then the cycle =
repeats. 


Our experiences inside our created dream world have an impact o=
n us when we wake up. From time to time, we remember our dreams and reflect=
 on them. The experiences certainly carry on into our waking state to some =
extent, and then back into the next dream experience. 


By looking at ever=
y question from three points of time, we get three different answers. The d=
ream world is real for it's duration, unreal between cycles and is conditio=
nally real when looking across cycles. Freedom is interacting with the worl=
d with no attachment from inside the world; realizing the absolute unrealit=
y of the world from outside; and is both of these when looking across cycle=
s. 


>From all points of view, the thinning of the accumulated conditioning=
 (vAsanA-tAnavam) is the key.

Disagreements and differen=

, I will explain a few of the points you have raised in your email, from my=
 perspective of course. 



<< You have to complete the story.>. 


The rea=

<< This story seems to like I used=C2=A0 to re=

so far is true.and he has the ability to shape shift and transportation. So=
 what?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang.>> 

As per the Tantric s=
criptures, even Lord Shiva in=C2=A0 his form of Bhairava smokes ganja, drin=
ks alcohol, eats with dogs and chandalas, roams around naked in the smashan=
a. So is taking intoxicants a sufficient criteria to judge anyone's spiritu=
ality? Not for me! 

, 

<<what does God mean in this tale? >> 


I will te=
ll you how I see it. In this story, God means infinity. Now what is infinit=
y? It cannot be described, it cannot be named, it cannot be understood usin=
g the five sense organs. Science does not understand infinity, art=C2=A0 do=
es not understand infinity, nothing or nobody=C2=A0 understands infinity. I=
t is a summation of all that we know, all that we can=C2=A0 imagine and all=
 that is impossible for us to imagine. It is an incomprehensible force that=
 runs through everything, from the most loveable to the most despicable , f=
rom the most holy to the most unholy, from the greatest saint to the stupid=
est piece of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean in the farthest planet=
 in the farthest solar system in the farthest universe. 



Now question is=
, can an average human being "know" this mysterious and all pervading force=
? Knowing implies understanding. Clearly no. Then how does one interact wit=
h such a thing? One way is to consider=C2=A0 everything, and I mean EVERYTH=
ING from living to non-living, as a manifestation of that force and thus le=
arn to love the same unconditionally without expecting anything in return. =
No wonder such unconditional love is not easy. It needs tremendous effort t=
o change our own conditioning of the mind, and work on our inherent biases =
and prejudices. That is what the=C2=A0 aim of sadhana is, in my view. To wo=
rk on oneself, to make one ready to be able to unconditionally love everyth=
ing. The greater number of entities one can love unconditionally, that much=
 little bit closer one can come to interacting with the truly infinite. And=
 those few rare human beings who can love a whole universe unconditionally,=
 are possibly the closest to this supreme and unknowable
 force. In common =
language, we call them Rishis. 

I like all forms of=C2=A0 Deities, for I f=
ind something beautiful in everyone of them. And I also like the One behind=
 forms, which is so perfectly transcendental that it cannot be comprehended=
 ever. It's like the surface area of the fine tip of a needle, or the gap b=
etween the two breaths, or the millionth part of a single hair, or the endl=
ess-ness of space, or the bottomless well of stillness in the mind at certa=
in points in meditation. The only thing that stops me from getting a better=
 understanding the grandeur of=C2=A0 this formless entity are the limitatio=
ns of my own mind and body, that I have acquired over millions of births. T=
hat is why Sadhana. To slowly gnaw away at my own mind, to be better able t=
o appreciate this endless, nameless entity. G_d. 


I do not=C2=A0 believe =
in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirth? If the Universe itself gets born ove=
r and over and over, if Rama and Krshna come back at every cycle, who am I =
to demand that I should not get born? Infact, when a person proverbially fi=
nishes off his/her karmas, they merely go to another plane in this Universe=
 and stay there for eons of time, since time anyway moves very, very slowly=
 in different realms. But then, if this force so wants, it can send back an=
y of the souls from any of the realms to any of the other realms to serve a=
 certain function. And if a soul stays in a certain higher realm and in for=
ced to take rebirth again, the seeds of the karmas - which never really die=
 off - are=C2=A0 watered again by the environment of birth and they sprout =
into saplings. And this may go even beyond one cycle of creation. Else why =
would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very same enemies that they had been figh=
ting in the past cycle of creation? Mahabharata says
 so. I=C2=A0 believe i=
t. 



What then is the final aim of all this, spirituality etc? I don't kn=
ow. Maybe, to teach us to broaden our perspectives and consequentially less=
en our attachments to our otherwise mundane lives and its mundane problems.=
 This is like a circular roller-coaster ride we see in local melas. Tighten=
 the seat-belts, bring a smile in the heart, be detached and enjoy the show=
! 


Best of luck and take good care of yourself!

=C2=A0 Dear Rajarshi Bhai, 
How are you? You=
 have to complete the story. you have to tell what happened when X went to =
meet this man in temple.or anything else which happened. It is like somebod=
y gone in kitchen to get rest of meal and not come back. 


First I have to=
 thank you for writing that story about Divine Mother Sri Chinnmastaji. I h=
ad developed a fear about Her but 3 times I got spiritual indications over =
the period of 2 months that I should write my story. When you wrote back su=
ddenly my fear about Her melted away and I did immediate prayers to Her. Th=
anks. 


The other thing is can I dare to say that I do not agree what is i=
n this thread. Why does this so called spiritual man has to dump his failur=
e on=C2=A0 religion. If people do not believe in religion or God or afterli=
fe, it is their problem. We are not all equal. We all do not come from same=
 stock. We are born with different conditions, go through different life ex=
periences and go where our fate or destiny takes us. This world is composed=
 of 3 gunas and there is always going to tension of different sort. Why=C2=
=A0 blame it on religion or God, why not on greed and desire to control oth=
ers and lord over them using what ever mean. 


This story seems to=C2=A0 l=
ike I used to read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a siddha if =
the story so far is true.and he has the ability to shape shift and transpor=
tation. So what?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang. 


what does G=
od mean in this tale? Is it Creator God or Divine Lord Of Sri Vrindavan or=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 Divine=C2=A0 Mother or=C2=A0 Self Realisation or Universal God=
 or Jewish God or Formless God or Fire God?? After all there was a dhoni fi=
re there? Or some other God ?? 


Sri Vrindavan has a rolling population.=
=C2=A0 They are not in confusion. Many people come there only for curiosity=
, many other come only for Darshan in the Temple and go back home happy. ma=
ny others come with different desires. It is very wrong to expect from a pe=
rson who is in fifth grade to have knowledge of 15th grade. 


Many times p=
eople go to temple to pray and ask for certain things and if it does not ha=
ppen they become very anti religion and anti God. So what?? It has nothing =
to do with me or you or anybody else. It is their life. 


I was very very =
very=C2=A0 ill. Nobody was helping me. Many people were giving me lot of pa=
in.=C2=A0=C2=A0 I went=C2=A0 from Religious place to religious place, templ=
e to temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing seem to worked. Then I took up r=
eligious practise of doing mantra japa and other things which are in script=
ures and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It is totally religious discipli=
ne according to our scriptures. 


Do you drive a car? Did you pass you exa=
m first time? I do not drive a car. It will take me several exams to pass i=
t. Many people pass their test first time and drive successfully. Does it m=
ean I should blame car or exams or examiner or road for my failure??? .Many=
 people take up spiritual life and if they do not find success quickly they=
 blame=C2=A0 religion and God. 


I also used to think that a real experien=
ce of God would be very powerful thing. but there are other aspects to it. =
If=C2=A0 someone is totally=C2=A0 dependent on Divine Mother and calls on H=
er day and night, but yet he is not ready for certain energy or his body is=
 not clean enough to receive a new light, then Divine Mother would appear t=
o him in very gentle way to comfort him and to console so that he remains o=
n the path. She will appear right in front of him but he only sees the Gold=
en Aura and not what is middle of it because he is not yet ready. Whenever =
I think of that moment I am filled with deep bliss and joy and wonderment. =



You are a special person doing everyday intense haven to spread the ligh=
t.Many other people in this group are doing haven everyday to fill their li=
fe with light of Divine Beings. This is a complete religious method which i=
s also totally spiritual thing.Please do not get impressed with pseudo spir=
itual talk and tales of shape shifting. Is everything alright in your every=
day life because I felt a sadness in your mail? I am sure I am very wrong i=
n=C2=A0 this. 


Few days ago Olympic flame passed right outside my road.I =
did not go out to see it. I kept holding to the Light which comes out of Di=
vine=C2=A0 Mothers Feet hoping it will become permanent in my life. 


Good=

Dear Ajit, 


I am in=C2=A0 =
complete agreement with your thoughts.=C2=A0 A spiritual man once said, "Re=
ligion has been created to shield people from God".=C2=A0 


When I first h=
eard this I was not convinced and thought it was some fake secularism. Late=
ly I realized this is literally true. Heavy psychological constructs are cr=
eated by religions to protect an average person from the real experience of=
 God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if and when it happens, it=
 can effectively cause a hurricane in your average life and pretty much des=
troy all your well laid plans. 



I will briefly narrate a true and intere=
sting incident. 



An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to=C2=A0 =
stay there for some=C2=A0 years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sa=
dhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unbli=
nking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at th=
e satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged =
looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, "Maharaj, please tel=
l us some words of God". The man became angry, and retorted back, "Why? Why=
 waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will=
 run away. So please=C2=A0 continue with your lectures as you were doing be=
fore I came in". Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhi=
le the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the s=
ky and then got up and started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu wh=
o was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, "He is a sadhu who comes=
 to Vrindavan once in a
 while, but he has probably lost his mental balance=
 due to smoking too much=C2=A0 ganja". Now X, who was sitting there, for so=
me weird reason felt attracted to that ragged man and went out to see where=
 the guy was going. As he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned=
 around and spoke to X in clear English, "Hello, I was waiting for you to c=
ome and join me." X was of course taken aback, did not expect the man to sp=
eak in English and more over he had no clue how the man got to know that he=
 knew English (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). 


=

The man continued, "My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an=
 Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering =
sadhu since then." X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing =
the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, "All this is bogus. Actually this God thin=
g itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of S=
adhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all=C2=
=A0 the religious troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little irritated, =
"Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you h=
ave been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven't met a single genuine s=
adhu yet, how is it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take=C2=A0 V=
rindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confuse=
d as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot me=
et that man, he is not accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The ro=
ot
 of all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man=
 cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human=
 brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a =
magnified woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, o=
ne day he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may=
 even acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be regar=
ded=C2=A0 by others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I =
say the root of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a fin=
ite mind and then stressing that one has understood correctly." While talki=
ng, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja,=C2=A0 and=
 in one pull finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for=
 about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continu=
ed, "You (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don't=
 get
 confused by all these show of spirituality you see in holy places. Wh=
en I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of=
 youth. I was an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew=
 up. But then one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roami=
ng for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact =
with this thing." As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, wo=
man and a=C2=A0 young girl came out of the house. They invited him inside a=
nd Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a=
 lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you som=
ething interesting if you join me. 



After an hour inside the house, X wa=
s feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits=
 and sweets for their food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar's =
feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man =
is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shameles=
sly accepting the hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As=
 soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman a=
nd the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards t=
he cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing =
the opp direction to the cot. He too turned round to see=C2=A0 what was goi=
ng on. What he saw made his jaw drop=C2=A0 open in shock. Instead of the ol=
d, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young ma=
n, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, =
emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up
 the whole room. He had a shav=
ed head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful =
eyes! It looked not a human being any more but a god sitting in place of wh=
at was even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar. 



X=
 did not know what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him=
 to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and wal=
ked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousnes=
s. When he woke up,=C2=A0 he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location=
 with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand=
 and took him inside the temple precincts.=C2=A0 There he saw a dhuni burni=
ng, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all ov=
er his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that meditating man=
 to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was talking ab=
out, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan=
 currently who has an idea what God really means. After providing direction=
s of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and immed=
iately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into
 uncon=
sciousness again. 



When X woke up, he was in the room in that house, lyi=
ng on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, with a mi=
schievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as directed.

=C2=A0 Dear Prasanth, 


> To those who say that=
 they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion 




In general, many of those =
who don't believe in religion or God are being more honest than=C2=A0 those=
 who do. After all, most people who believe in God look at him as a limited=
 being to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions are most apparent =
when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formalize =
these biases. 


While being mired in this word of duality, we think that a=
n ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of "paapa" that we en=
gage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that=
 others look at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept of=
 God. We "God believers" are the culprit. 


We all have plenty of paapa an=
d punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be st=
eadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn "paapa" and =
leave the "punya" intact. It is us "God believers" who look at our lives, i=
gnoring all the "paapa phala". We look at one or two instances of "punya ph=
ala" and declare our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial observ=
er sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We "God believers" are the cul=
prit. 


For the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spir=
itual practices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds =
and minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti=C2=A0 is strong, =
and time really flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual =
bhakti and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it =
for what it is, and laughs at us. We "God believers" are the culprit. 


Th=
e best way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the "non-be=
lievers" and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our=
 lack of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselve=
s, the world will be served. 


If we see God as the limitless=C2=A0 power =
that he is, he is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture him withi=
n a religion. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and should as=
k each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach the highe=
r goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them without questi=
on. They ask us to place our heads on them with reverence, and try to preve=
nt the spiritually advanced from going any farther.

anting* a non-existence or no re-birth, i.e. fear or aversion for rebirth. =
Wanting not to be reborn is a want too! When the true light of Self shines =
unblocked in one, one does not view either death or deathlessness or birth =
or birthlessness as better or worse.</font></div><div align=3D"LEFT"><font =
