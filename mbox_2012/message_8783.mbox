Dear Aparana,

Mantra is done like this : 

once while inhaling and once wh=
ile exhaling.
through continuous efforts a stage automatically comes when i=
t gets embeded in our breathing system and then it runs with our rhythem.
I=
t all depends upon HIS grace, keep on putting efforts.
But do not count man=
tra, it is only for initial stages when u count,
 even while counting ur fo=
cus is on numbers which is bad
it is the only  ceaseles pray , japa which i=
s best.through practice it is possible and possible when one has deep love =
for God.
Even mantra stops at advance stages as then soul itself travels fu=
rther.

Mantra=3Done which keeps mind here in present

   one can Meet HIM =
when one does not have any desire and I have seen ur many mails and even th=
is desire should not be there that when we will relise HIM


USKE LIYE ITNI=
 TADAP HO ki WO MAZBOOR HO JAYE AANE KE LIYE.

   See Hanuman ji , his body=
 was immersed in Ram nam, he never desired anything.

These is no rule, tho=
se who follow rule , they have time to see rules but those who r immersed i=
n HIS LOVE , they feel their body is just tool through which HE is working.=
their   I     dies.
see Gopis in Love of Krishna

  It is HIS will, accept =
in all circumstances, Surrender is the key, Be kid, new born baby, who does=
 not know anything except his mother,

Did Shabri from Ramayan followd any =
rules, rules apply for Sakam Bhakti, means there r desires, avod all this, =
no desire of even realising HIM,it will also bloch.ceasless pray, and keep =
dhayan of HIM 

  one should remeber HIM in Mahkhane or Pakhana, where is H=
E not present, who except HIM is presnt.

    Realised person see HIM every=
wheer and nothing else.becuse theer is no Duality
 
U R DOCTOR, SEE ur pati=
ents as LORD , u r also LORD , LORD in form of  doctor , serving LORD patie=
nts.
where r u, HE IS alone.Transform ur thought process like this wheer th=
oughts will reduce to one just GOD.
Teach ur mind this ,when  Mind understa=
nds , it starts helping.Donot seek rules,
Rule following people can never R=
ealise HIM.What so ever way u can connect to HIM , do that way, 
He will gu=
ide u  through u only LISTEN to HIM , inside u  

Hope it helps
regards
