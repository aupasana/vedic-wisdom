"If It is non-dual why does It seem to be dual?" said Hemachuda.
"If you lo=

"This nameless, formless Being seems so abs=

inconceivable I have no idea how to relate to It," said Parasuram=
a.
Please tell me how to worship It."
"Worship It in any form you wish," He=
malekha replied. "Because
the Self is the knowing principle in your own min=
d, it understands
your innermost desire and operates through your chosen de=
ity to reveal
Itself to you. As you worship your deity your mind becomes su=

and subtler, quieter and quieter, and at special moments dissolves in=
to
you, the worshipper...who is none other than the Self. At that point you=
 find yourself to be beyond all forms, non-dual, and eternally
aware.
