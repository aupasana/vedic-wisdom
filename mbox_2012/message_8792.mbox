Dear Rakeshji and other learned members of the group,
I had one clarificati=
on on the point of being flexible with the rules. As per my understanding f=
rom other emails in this group, one should always start with a rule and the=
n gradually move over to complete surrender wherein there are no rules. A k=
id who wants to run a marathon needs to follow rules/discipline for practic=
ing daily. Once he has developed a practice routine, it is ok even if he do=
esnt follow rules. Similarly for this long journey towards realization.
But=
 how does one identify the boundary at which you stop following a rule? Man=
y a times, I find keeping count of mantras slightly distracting and feel th=
at I should instead just sit and meditate for some time. May be more time s=
ome day and less time on other days.
Any advice or practical pointers in th=
is regard will be very helpful.
Kind regards,Vishal

      Dear Aparana,



Mantra is don=
e like this : 



once while inhaling and once while exhaling.

through con=
tinuous efforts a stage automatically comes when it gets embeded in our bre=
athing system and then it runs with our rhythem.

It all depends upon HIS g=
race, keep on putting efforts.

But do not count mantra, it is only for ini=
tial stages when u count,

 even while counting ur focus is on numbers whic=
h is bad

it is the only  ceaseles pray , japa which is best.through practi=
ce it is possible and possible when one has deep love for God.

Even mantra=
 stops at advance stages as then soul itself travels further.



Mantra=3Do=
ne which keeps mind here in present



one can Meet HIM when one does not h=
ave any desire and I have seen ur many mails and even this desire should no=
t be there that when we will relise HIM



USKE LIYE ITNI TADAP HO ki WO MA=
ZBOOR HO JAYE AANE KE LIYE.



See Hanuman ji , his body was immersed in Ra=
m nam, he never desired anything.



These is no rule, those who follow rul=
e , they have time to see rules but those who r immersed in HIS LOVE , they=
 feel their body is just tool through which HE is working.their   I     die=
s.

see Gopis in Love of Krishna



It is HIS will, accept in all circumsta=
nces, Surrender is the key, Be kid, new born baby, who does not know anythi=
ng except his mother,



Did Shabri from Ramayan followd any rules, rules a=
pply for Sakam Bhakti, means there r desires, avod all this, no desire of e=
ven realising HIM,it will also bloch.ceasless pray, and keep dhayan of HIM =




one should remeber HIM in Mahkhane or Pakhana, where is HE not present,=
 who except HIM is presnt.



Realised person see HIM everywheer and nothin=
g else.becuse theer is no Duality

 

U R DOCTOR, SEE ur patients as LORD ,=
 u r also LORD , LORD in form of  doctor , serving LORD patients.

where r =
u, HE IS alone.Transform ur thought process like this wheer thoughts will r=
educe to one just GOD.

Teach ur mind this ,when  Mind understands , it sta=
rts helping.Donot seek rules,

Rule following people can never Realise HIM.=
What so ever way u can connect to HIM , do that way, 

He will guide u  thr=
ough u only LISTEN to HIM , inside u  



Hope it helps

regards
