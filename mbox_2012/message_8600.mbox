 =
     A short conversation between a student and teacher.

Chant as you read=
 along. Chant any name.



If you find it tough to chant, play this another=
 tab/window

http://youtu.be/SIqag-x5gqI



Teacher : You are Duracell.



=
Student : err=E2=80=A6.. what?



Teacher : *while smoking* or energizer or=
 everyday or nippo.



Student : =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6. hain=
? *scratches head*, you have lost it.



Teacher : I lost "it", a long time=
 ago its time for you to loose it ,

LOL



Student : How am I Duracell or =
any of those damn battery companies you

just mentioned?



Teacher : What =
do I get, if I prove it?



Student : What do you want?



Teacher : That y=
ou intentionally make a fool of yourself in front of

people who have not l=
ost it.



Student : okay, deal done. Prove it.



Teacher : Think twice.

=


Student : I have thought 4 times.



Teacher : Ho ho ho, what a fun day I=
 will have.



Student : Yeah, right. *rolls eyes like a supermodel saying =
whatever*



Teacher : Have you ever seen a battery powered toy? Especially=
 the one

which is modeled in the form of a bear, and claps its hands as so=
on as

it is powered on. Its hands hold two plates which strike each other =
,

the bear's eyes light up as soon as the battery is put in, and boom, we
=

are ready to go.



Student : Yes, yes, I have seen those. There are other=
 types also, like

when you put batteries in a car model, it suddenly start=
s operating, and

going bonkers, or the teddy bear one, which starts repeat=
ing some cuddly

lines. It is loved by girls.



Teacher : Yes, exactly. Yo=
u, right now, are the teddy bear, which girls

and everybody loves.



Stud=
ent : =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6. the fuck?



Teacher : aww!! Ho=
w cute , my little child is thinking in terms of

profanities. Do you know =
why you are here?



Student : *thinks in mind about all the philosophical =
stuff he has read,

and knew this question was widely discussed and asked, =
and thus becomes

happy"=E2=80=A6. why?



Teacher : Because , somebody fuc=
ked somebody, LOL. But anyways, leave

this fucking business aside for a mo=
ment. Lets go back to the

discussion, the end of which will be very fun.

=


Student: we were on the topic that I am a teddy bear.



Teacher : Don't =
twist my words, I said right now you are akin to a teddy

bear. You have be=
en that car, the helicopter , the teddy, the bear who

claps, basically all=
 the battery powered toys earlier. In philosophical

terms they are called =
"births".



Student : How may I ask?



Teacher : What is your name?



St=
udent : Chaman Sharma ( name changed due to security & other humorous

reas=
ons)



Teacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma

as the bear =
(the battery powered toy) who claps and claps and claps,

that "I am Chaman=
 Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I am 20 years old

, i like this girl,=
 I love playing sports, I live here, I read this, I

hate that, I this, and=
 I that", okay?



Student : Go on.. * feeling a bit ridiculous about himse=
lf*



Teacher : So when Chaman dies, which is going to happen sooner than
=

later, do you know what happens or what that means?



Student : I die, bu=
t in reality "I" don't die.



Teacher : Very good, you have read that off =
of a book, ever realized it?

Are you not afraid of death?



Student : No,=
 I am not afraid of death.



The lights turn off in the room, there is tot=
al darkness, for 5 minutes

there is no noise, but Chaman gets terrified, a=
nd then a pair of deep

red eyes appear in the dark, and in the most ghastl=
y voice ever asks Mr

Chaman, "why are you so afraid? the basis of all fear=
 is death, and only

the lights have gone out, I haven't even started with =
you yet, if you

say you are not going to die, then why so scared?"



Sudd=
enly the lights turn back on, the teacher is laughing his ass off,

with Ch=
aman shivering.



Teacher : You said you were not afraid.



Student : I n=
ever meant it, like that.



Teacher : Then in what way did you mean it? Ta=
ke it as a lesson that

practical stuff in this spirituality business is fa=
r greater than all

your books combined. You get lost while reading, you th=
ink you are

different. To me you are no worse than the thousand others I m=
eet,

in-fact they are better off without the texts you have studied.



St=
udent : Agreed, but don't scare me like that. Again.



Teacher : I will, i=
f you make such ridiculous claims again. Anyways,

where were we? The death=
 of the teddy bear. Yes. But mind you the teddy

remains, the outer shell r=
emains, but teddy is dead. The outer shell is

either buried or burnt, in e=
ssence done away with, because it is of no

use. Right?



Student : Right
=



Teacher : Wrong. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this, when you

remo=
ve the battery from the toy, what happens? The toy is literally

useless, i=
t can't clap, it can't shout, it can't cry, it can't do shit.

Thus, at dea=
th, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Chaman's body. You

never die, you a=
re only the battery powering this personality which

leads to powering your=
 body.



Student: How can you even=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6



Teacher : Lets con=
sider that you are two batteries, two aa sized ones.

When you plug the bat=
teries into a car, suddenly the car comes to life,

without the battery the=
 car is idle, but as soon as I put the battery

in, the car goes=E2=80=A6=
=E2=80=A6.. beep beep honk honk, move, I am a car.



Student : sits in sil=
ence knowing well that interrupting now will be the

biggest mistake ever.
=



Teacher :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it into=


lets say a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,
=

or acts mushy. And when I pull the battery out?



Student : Teddy is idle=
, literally useless.



Teacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the same batte=
ry that powered the

car, it was the same battery that powered the teddy be=
ar, and it is the

same battery that can power any toy, correct?



Student=
 : Correct



Teacher : While the battery is in the car, it believes itself=
 to be the

car. It believes "yesssss, i am a car, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 =
mm

torque, top speed 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at the back, hot woman in m=
y

passengers seat, I am the king baby, look at how hot I am"



Student: O=
h dear god=E2=80=A6.



Teacher : Then I take out the battery from the car.=
 And PHAT it is a

useless piece of metal. And I plug the battery into a te=
ddy, suddenly it

believes itself to be the teddy, it goes " yeeeeessssss, =
I am the teddy,

I am mushy, I am soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddl=
y I am, I can

even clap my hands ", and when I take the battery out, PHAT,=
 the teddy

is=E2=80=A6..



Student : Useless, and dead.



Teacher : That=
s a useless conclusion, it is known by the world, not

realized. Every tom =
dick and harry knows that, Lets go deeper. The point

is the battery confus=
es itself to be the teddy or the god damn car.



Student : So the battery =
is the soul?



Teacher : *smacks on the student's head* Who said that?



=
Student : You did.



Teacher : *another phatek on the head of the student*=
 When did I say?

You read it in one of your fancy articles and commentarie=
s and satsangs

that people do, genius, and you read it all too wrong, you =
read it and

thus think you 'know', you never practiced, fools you people a=
re. Most

of the time you people are fed bullshit and you gobble it up like=
 pigs

in mud. That reminds me we haven't had a pepperoni  pizza in a long
=

time, lets order one. LOL



Student : Sorry=E2=80=A6



Teacher : Don't b=
e, you are my child, I love you. Anyways , back to our

discussion on toys.=
 The confusion of the battery. And thus Chaman, you

confuse yourself to be=
 Chaman. This is the 67432th time , you have been

plugged into a a toy (re=
ad body) and the confusion prevails. Focus on

the "confusion" aspect.



S=
tudent : Then who am I?



Teacher : You are the ever lasting consciousness=
, the universal bliss,

the infinite, the ever pervading light of the unive=
rse!!! Breathe in and

out and feel the bliss!!



Student : Yess!!! this i=
s what I read, * breathes in and out deeply*

*Smells huge amounts of odor*=
=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6 What is that smell?



Teacher : I just farted, feels so=
 blissful, did you feel your bliss too?



Student : Ewwwww=E2=80=A6.



Te=
acher : Bhutni ke, do you think we guys are fools who have spent lives

in =
search of who we are, and you will know just by breathing in and out,

and =
thinking you are the ever lasting consciousness and all that???

Befkuf!! C=
haman kahin ka!!



Student : But you only said that  "You are the ever las=
ting

consciousness, the universal bliss, the infinite, the ever pervading
=

light of the universe!!! Breathe in and out and feel the bliss!!"



Teach=
er : It is called a test, and needless to say you have scored a

compartmen=
t.



Student : Hey ram=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.



Teacher : So back to=
 who you are, you are just like the battery who is

the source of that body=
 and the personality and confuses itself to be "

I am Chaman Sharma, age 2=
0, resident of vasant vihar, have a girlfriend,

am a male, love to party, =
own a mercedez, worship a a little, interested

in god and whatever "



St=
udent : So who am I?



Teacher : You are duracell=E2=80=A6..How do they wr=
ite post a mathematics

solution=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6Q.E.D or hence p=
roved. QED =3D  quite easily done.



Student : Thats one more self identif=
ication of being duracell



Teacher : Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.=




Student: *Feels quite proud*



Teacher : And THAT is one more self ide=
ntification.



Student : Hey Ram!!



Teacher : Ram Ram.



Student : So I=
 theoretically understand it , but how do I actually

realize it?



Teache=
r : You do Sadhana.



Student : Sitting in a yogic pose and focusing on th=
e lotus and all?



Teacher : I will fucking beat you to your death if you =
repeat this

bullshit ever again.



Student: Sorry=E2=80=A6



Teacher : N=
o need to be. That is what is meant by Sadhana to most

people. But does an=
yone know what is Sadhana?



Student : You shed some light on it?



Teach=
er: What do you think I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana is

basically =
in essence, and mark these all important words.

" YOU trying to convince y=
ourself that "you" are not YOU "



Births are spent on this my boy, births=
 not lives, it takes a lot of

effort to tell and convince yourself that yo=
u are just not you.



Student : and how do you do that?



Teacher : By sa=
dhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You

eventually yourself beco=
me the form of the mantra that you chant, thus

realizing the deity( the bi=
g daddy battery)/ the specific form of the

one (the source of all the Big =
and small batteries). A mantra means man

ki tarana, does it not?



Studen=
t : So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the battery and not

this pers=
onality?



Teacher : Yes, but the day "you" realize, "you" will go dead, t=
o

yourself.



Student: I am beginning to understand a little, can you exp=
lain where

does a deity stand in this whole battery concept?



Teacher : =
If you are the battery, the battery has to have a source, you

are not svay=
ambhu that you exist on you own. The deity is like a huge

power station in=
 your comparison. It is almost infinite, but since it is

a power station i=
t is bound to have a boundary somewhere, but to you, aa

sized battery it i=
s endless. Chaman's source is his parents, but

chaman's actual source's (b=
attery) parent is the power station.



Student : Hmmm=E2=80=A6.. that's wh=
y she is worshipped as ma?



Teacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a g=
irl who has realized that

he/she himself is the battery and then went on t=
o become one with a

power station and thus sees himself/herself in everyth=
ing because the

power station is the source of everything , of all batteri=
es. And since

he/she actually knows that all elements too are currents and=
 everything

else too, he/she actually sees it as that. And thus, the "mira=
cles". Let

say I fully well don't see a difference between me and this tab=
le, thus

I am this table, thus If i wish to make it fly, I can do it, beca=
use I

am actually it. To you it is a table, to me it is just a current, wh=
o is

just "me".



Student: Oooohhhhhhhh=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.



Teacher : H=
e maybe sai baba to you, but thats how your eyes perceive him

to be as, an=
 old man with frail clothing, belongs to shirdi etc etc, but

inside he is =
far beyond what you or I can comprehend. He first realized

he was a batter=
y by doing penance, thus killing himself in the process,

the he realized t=
hat the battery is as good as the power station because

the current is the=
 same, so he became one with that, and then he went

beyond and came back t=
o guide as he was chosen, just like many others

are, like my great teacher=
, guru nanak dev, Ramakrishna and all

others=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6


=

Student : And the source of the power station is?



Teacher : The one- Sa=
tya shri akaal , he/she/it can't be put into words

because he is infinite =
and the words are finite. It is purely on

defining him religious wars, rio=
ts between religions , and intellectual

discussions and debates on this th=
ing called internet happen, but

he/she/it is far beyond comprehension. Man=
y people focus on that , and

get lost, but focus on the power station (dei=
ty) and it will take you to

big daddy.

Imagine an endless field of curren=
t in comparison of the power station ,

an endless current which exists and=
 all others are a figment of it. The

power stations are a part of it, the =
current has taken the form of one

concentrated zone.. But even this contai=
ns error of speech, so chuck it.

The ultimate is only realized when you ar=
e one with the power station so

lets focus there.



Student : So the one =
has taken forms of different power stations to help

the batteries who are =
spread out to help unite back with it?



Teacher : Brilliant.



Student: =
So all our lives we debate/fight and cut each other off to

claim which pow=
er station (deity) is more powerful over the other and

superior to all oth=
ers, when in truth our eyes perceive them(deities) to

be different, when t=
hey are in essence one(Satya shri akaal) and

laughing back at us?



Teach=
er : ho ho ho=E2=80=A6.. Go on.



Student : And we try to worship 10 diffe=
rent ones and always think that

we should worship as many to get maximum b=
enefit for our mistakingly

confused identities of teddy , the car and all =
other toys?



Teacher : *smokes slowly*=E2=80=A6 I am listening.



Studen=
t: So the biggest fools are those who are lost in debates and

pseudo breat=
hing in and out and raising kundalinis with peacock feathers

and punches t=
o the spine, reading stuff and debating on concepts which

they don't know =
a thing about?



Teacher: Yes,Speaking of Kundalini, she is basically you,=
 she is the

battery. the stupidest thing in the world is this concept of "=
my

kundalini", err=E2=80=A6. you are her you idiot, how is she yours? Anyw=
ays ,

many make this error, but it is essential because other wise you can=
't

explain the concept in speech. And if you do fully realize you are her,=


"you" will be phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets
=

say a form, you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full

glory=
 . Whatever you are worshipping is "you", who is without all the

limitatio=
ns of Chaman/teddy/car/toy.



Student: So then how do realized souls stay =
in their bodies post their

realization?



Teacher: Intentional identifica=
tion with the personality by permission

from the power station to fulfill =
some higher purpose of the power

station to guide more batteries to realiz=
e that they are not toys. But

they can leave in an instant, because they k=
now realities that are much

higher than our world.



Student : So what is=
 moksha?



Teacher : It is a concept that is best left alone, if you haven=
't merged

back with a power station yourself first. You tell me when you h=
ave

merged back, how do you know what if feels like to be merged back? You=


yourself have become one with your source, so "you" don't remain, even

t=
he battery has dissolved, so how do "you" explain it? You wont remember

it=
, because you are not there.



Student : I can't explain it.



Teacher : =
We can't, It is like explaining the color red to a blind man.

You will say=
 mars  is red or the red light is red, he will say I have

been blind from =
birth I don't know what you are talking about. You will

say tomato, he wil=
l say fuck off.



Student : Yes, so It can't be explained.



Teacher : it=
 can be to an extent, but it is one ridiculously convoluted

topic. To add =
to ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one toy is a car, one toy

is a helicopter,=
 one toy is a turtle, mind you battery is the same, but

the car is very di=
fferent form the toy, thus if you explain a high level

concept to both, bo=
th will understand differently and have a go at it

with debates and what n=
ot, which leads to more confusion. Better is both

realize it themselves. S=
o you focus on realizing that you are duracell

first, mr chaman, everythin=
g else comes later. Thus, You are duracell.

Now time for my reward for my =
winning the bet. Dance naked on the road.



Student : What?



Teacher : Y=
ou thought 4 times.



Student: But I will be disgraced.



Teacher : Nope,=
 Chaman will be, you are duracell, they will laugh at

Chaman, who is your =
67432nd incarnation, you have done this thousand

times before, so what??

=


Student : I hate you.



Teacher : I love you too.



Student : You are s=
erious on this?



Teacher : Very



Student: : This is why some of the hig=
her ones don't give a shit about

roaming naked and doing wild stuff, just =
to keep people away from them.



Teacher : Yes, but a lot of frauds copy a=
nd disgrace the higher ones.



Student : Fine, I will do it. But you will =
handle my parent's reaction.



Teacher : Done.



After the student did th=
e act, nobody seemed to recall the act the next

day, yet every one saw it =
that day, and seemed to make faces at the

student for an hour or so. How e=
verybody forgot is a different story

altogether.



Do sadhana, before you=
r battery is pulled out, replugged into another

toy and yet again, your co=
nfusion will prevail driving you to do things

that will push you further a=
nd further down.



Jai Shree Radheya!!

st it.<br>
<br>
Teacher : I lost "it", a long time ago its time for you to =
loose it ,<br>
LOL<br>
<br>
Student : How am I Duracell or any of those dam=
n battery companies you<br>
just mentioned?<br>
<br>
Teacher : What do I ge=
t, if I prove it?<br>
<br>
Student : What do you want?<br>
<br>
Teacher : T=
hat you intentionally make a fool of yourself in front of<br>
people who ha=
ve not lost it.<br>
<br>
Student : okay, deal done. Prove it.<br>
<br>
Teac=
her : Think twice.<br>
<br>
Student : I have thought 4 times.<br>
<br>
Teac=
her : Ho ho ho, what a fun day I will have.<br>
<br>
Student : Yeah, right.=
 *rolls eyes like a supermodel saying whatever*<br>
<br>
Teacher : Have you=
 ever seen a battery powered toy? Especially the one<br>
which is modeled i=
n the form of a bear, and claps its hands as soon as<br>
it is powered on. =
Its hands hold two plates which strike each other ,<br>
the bear's eyes lig=
ht up as soon as the battery is put in, and boom, we<br>
are ready to go.<b=
r>
<br>
Student : Yes, yes, I have seen those. There are other types also, =
like<br>
when you put batteries in a car model, it suddenly starts operatin=
g, and<br>
going bonkers, or the teddy bear one, which starts repeating som=
e cuddly<br>
lines. It is loved by girls.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Yes, exactly. =
You, right now, are the teddy bear, which girls<br>
and everybody loves.<br=
>
<br>
Student : =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6. the fuck?<br>
<br>
T=
eacher : aww!! How cute , my little child is thinking in terms of<br>
profa=
nities. Do you know why you are here?<br>
<br>
Student : *thinks in mind ab=
out all the philosophical stuff he has read,<br>
and knew this question was=
 widely discussed and asked, and thus becomes<br>
happy"=E2=80=A6. why?<br>=

<br>
Teacher : Because , somebody fucked somebody, LOL. But anyways, leave=
<br>
this fucking business aside for a moment. Lets go back to the<br>
disc=
ussion, the end of which will be very fun.<br>
<br>
Student: we were on the=
 topic that I am a teddy bear.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Don't twist my words, I s=
aid right now you are akin to a teddy<br>
bear. You have been that car, the=
 helicopter , the teddy, the bear who<br>
claps, basically all the battery =
powered toys earlier. In philosophical<br>
terms they are called "births".<=
br>
<br>
Student : How may I ask?<br>
<br>
Teacher : What is your name?<br>=

<br>
Student : Chaman Sharma ( name changed due to security & other hu=
morous<br>
reasons)<br>
<br>
Teacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman=
 sharma<br>
as the bear (the battery powered toy) who claps and claps and c=
laps,<br>
that "I am Chaman Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I am 20 yea=
rs old<br>
, i like this girl, I love playing sports, I live here, I read t=
his, I<br>
hate that, I this, and I that", okay?<br>
<br>
Student : Go on..=
 * feeling a bit ridiculous about himself*<br>
<br>
Teacher : So when Chama=
n dies, which is going to happen sooner than<br>
later, do you know what ha=
ppens or what that means?<br>
<br>
Student : I die, but in reality "I" don'=
t die.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Very good, you have read that off of a book, ever=
 realized it?<br>
Are you not afraid of death?<br>
<br>
Student : No, I am =
not afraid of death.<br>
<br>
The lights turn off in the room, there is tot=
al darkness, for 5 minutes<br>
there is no noise, but Chaman gets terrified=
, and then a pair of deep<br>
red eyes appear in the dark, and in the most =
ghastly voice ever asks Mr<br>
Chaman, "why are you so afraid? the basis of=
 all fear is death, and only<br>
the lights have gone out, I haven't even s=
tarted with you yet, if you<br>
say you are not going to die, then why so s=
cared?"<br>
<br>
Suddenly the lights turn back on, the teacher is laughing =
his ass off,<br>
with Chaman shivering.<br>
<br>
Teacher : You said you wer=
e not afraid.<br>
<br>
Student : I never meant it, like that.<br>
<br>
Teac=
her : Then in what way did you mean it? Take it as a lesson that<br>
practi=
cal stuff in this spirituality business is far greater than all<br>
your bo=
oks combined. You get lost while reading, you think you are<br>
different. =
To me you are no worse than the thousand others I meet,<br>
in-fact they ar=
e better off without the texts you have studied.<br>
<br>
Student : Agreed,=
 but don't scare me like that. Again.<br>
<br>
Teacher : I will, if you mak=
e such ridiculous claims again. Anyways,<br>
where were we? The death of th=
e teddy bear. Yes. But mind you the teddy<br>
remains, the outer shell rema=
ins, but teddy is dead. The outer shell is<br>
either buried or burnt, in e=
ssence done away with, because it is of no<br>
use. Right?<br>
<br>
Student=
 : Right<br>
<br>
Teacher : Wrong. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this,=
 when you<br>
remove the battery from the toy, what happens? The toy is lit=
erally<br>
useless, it can't clap, it can't shout, it can't cry, it can't d=
o shit.<br>
Thus, at death, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Chaman's bod=
y. You<br>
never die, you are only the battery powering this personality wh=
ich<br>
leads to powering your body.<br>
<br>
Student: How can you even=E2=
=80=A6=E2=80=A6<br>
<br>
Teacher : Lets consider that you are two batteries=
, two aa sized ones.<br>
When you plug the batteries into a car, suddenly t=
he car comes to life,<br>
without the battery the car is idle, but as soon =
as I put the battery<br>
in, the car goes=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.. beep beep hon=
k honk, move, I am a car.<br>
<br>
Student : sits in silence knowing well t=
hat interrupting now will be the<br>
biggest mistake ever.<br>
<br>
Teacher=
 :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it into<br>
lets =
say a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,<br>
or =
acts mushy. And when I pull the battery out?<br>
<br>
Student : Teddy is id=
le, literally useless.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the sa=
me battery that powered the<br>
car, it was the same battery that powered t=
he teddy bear, and it is the<br>
same battery that can power any toy, corre=
ct?<br>
<br>
Student : Correct<br>
<br>
Teacher : While the battery is in t=
he car, it believes itself to be the<br>
car. It believes "yesssss, i am a =
car, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 mm<br>
torque, top speed 320kmph, 4 wheels, en=
gine at the back, hot woman in my<br>
passengers seat, I am the king baby, =
look at how hot I am"<br>
<br>
Student: Oh dear god=E2=80=A6.<br>
<br>
Teac=
her : Then I take out the battery from the car. And PHAT it is a<br>
useles=
s piece of metal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, suddenly it<br>
beli=
eves itself to be the teddy, it goes " yeeeeessssss, I am the teddy,<br>
I =
am mushy, I am soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddly I am, I can<br>
e=
ven clap my hands ", and when I take the battery out, PHAT, the teddy<br>
i=
s=E2=80=A6..<br>
<br>
Student : Useless, and dead.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Thats=
 a useless conclusion, it is known by the world, not<br>
realized. Every to=
m dick and harry knows that, Lets go deeper. The point<br>
is the battery c=
onfuses itself to be the teddy or the god damn car.<br>
<br>
Student : So t=
he battery is the soul?<br>
<br>
Teacher : *smacks on the student's head* W=
ho said that?<br>
<br>
Student : You did.<br>
<br>
Teacher : *another phate=
k on the head of the student* When did I say?<br>
You read it in one of you=
r fancy articles and commentaries and satsangs<br>
that people do, genius, =
and you read it all too wrong, you read it and<br>
thus think you 'know', y=
ou never practiced, fools you people are. Most<br>
of the time you people a=
re fed bullshit and you gobble it up like pigs<br>
in mud. That reminds me =
we haven't had a pepperoni  pizza in a long<br>
time, lets order one. LOL<b=
r>
<br>
Student : Sorry=E2=80=A6<br>
<br>
Teacher : Don't be, you are my ch=
ild, I love you. Anyways , back to our<br>
discussion on toys. The confusio=
n of the battery. And thus Chaman, you<br>
confuse yourself to be Chaman. T=
his is the 67432th time , you have been<br>
plugged into a a toy (read body=
) and the confusion prevails. Focus on<br>
the "confusion" aspect.<br>
<br>=

Student : Then who am I?<br>
<br>
Teacher : You are the ever lasting consc=
iousness, the universal bliss,<br>
the infinite, the ever pervading light o=
f the universe!!! Breathe in and<br>
out and feel the bliss!!<br>
<br>
Stud=
ent : Yess!!! this is what I read, * breathes in and out deeply*<br>
*Smell=
s huge amounts of odor*=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6 What is that smell?<br>
<br>
Teac=
her : I just farted, feels so blissful, did you feel your bliss too?<br>
<b=
r>
Student : Ewwwww=E2=80=A6.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Bhutni ke, do you think we=
 guys are fools who have spent lives<br>
in search of who we are, and you w=
ill know just by breathing in and out,<br>
and thinking you are the ever la=
sting consciousness and all that???<br>
Befkuf!! Chaman kahin ka!!<br>
<br>=

Student : But you only said that  "You are the ever lasting<br>
consciousn=
ess, the universal bliss, the infinite, the ever pervading<br>
light of the=
 universe!!! Breathe in and out and feel the bliss!!"<br>
<br>
Teacher : It=
 is called a test, and needless to say you have scored a<br>
compartment.<b=
r>
<br>
Student : Hey ram=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.<br>
<br>
Teacher : So=
 back to who you are, you are just like the battery who is<br>
the source o=
f that body and the personality and confuses itself to be "<br>
I am Chaman=
 Sharma, age 20, resident of vasant vihar, have a girlfriend,<br>
am a male=
, love to party, own a mercedez, worship a a little, interested<br>
in god =
and whatever "<br>
<br>
Student : So who am I?<br>
<br>
Teacher : You are d=
uracell=E2=80=A6..How do they write post a mathematics<br>
solution=E2=80=
=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6Q.E.D or hence proved. QED =3D  quite easily done.<br>=

<br>
Student : Thats one more self identification of being duracell<br>
<b=
r>
Teacher : Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.<br>
<br>
Student: *Feels =
quite proud*<br>
<br>
Teacher : And THAT is one more self identification.<b=
r>
<br>
Student : Hey Ram!!<br>
<br>
Teacher : Ram Ram.<br>
<br>
Student : =
So I theoretically understand it , but how do I actually<br>
realize it?<br=
>
<br>
Teacher : You do Sadhana.<br>
<br>
Student : Sitting in a yogic pose=
 and focusing on the lotus and all?<br>
<br>
Teacher : I will fucking beat =
you to your death if you repeat this<br>
bullshit ever again.<br>
<br>
Stud=
ent: Sorry=E2=80=A6<br>
<br>
Teacher : No need to be. That is what is meant=
 by Sadhana to most<br>
people. But does anyone know what is Sadhana?<br>
<=
br>
Student : You shed some light on it?<br>
<br>
Teacher: What do you thin=
k I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana is<br>
basically in essence, and m=
ark these all important words.<br>
" YOU trying to convince yourself that "=
you" are not YOU "<br>
<br>
Births are spent on this my boy, births not liv=
es, it takes a lot of<br>
effort to tell and convince yourself that you are=
 just not you.<br>
<br>
Student : and how do you do that?<br>
<br>
Teacher =
: By sadhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You<br>
eventually you=
rself become the form of the mantra that you chant, thus<br>
realizing the =
deity( the big daddy battery)/ the specific form of the<br>
one (the source=
 of all the Big and small batteries). A mantra means man<br>
ki tarana, doe=
s it not?<br>
<br>
Student : So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the b=
attery and not<br>
this personality?<br>
<br>
Teacher : Yes, but the day "y=
ou" realize, "you" will go dead, to<br>
yourself.<br>
<br>
Student: I am be=
ginning to understand a little, can you explain where<br>
does a deity stan=
d in this whole battery concept?<br>
<br>
Teacher : If you are the battery,=
 the battery has to have a source, you<br>
are not svayambhu that you exist=
 on you own. The deity is like a huge<br>
power station in your comparison.=
 It is almost infinite, but since it is<br>
a power station it is bound to =
have a boundary somewhere, but to you, aa<br>
sized battery it is endless. =
Chaman's source is his parents, but<br>
chaman's actual source's (battery) =
parent is the power station.<br>
<br>
Student : Hmmm=E2=80=A6.. that's why =
she is worshipped as ma?<br>
<br>
Teacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or=
 a girl who has realized that<br>
he/she himself is the battery and then we=
nt on to become one with a<br>
power station and thus sees himself/herself =
in everything because the<br>
power station is the source of everything , o=
f all batteries. And since<br>
he/she actually knows that all elements too =
are currents and everything<br>
else too, he/she actually sees it as that. =
And thus, the "miracles". Let<br>
say I fully well don't see a difference b=
etween me and this table, thus<br>
I am this table, thus If i wish to make =
it fly, I can do it, because I<br>
am actually it. To you it is a table, to=
 me it is just a current, who is<br>
just "me".<br>
<br>
Student: Oooohhhhh=
hhh=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.<br>
<br>
Teacher : He maybe sai baba to you, but tha=
ts how your eyes perceive him<br>
to be as, an old man with frail clothing,=
 belongs to shirdi etc etc, but<br>
inside he is far beyond what you or I c=
an comprehend. He first realized<br>
he was a battery by doing penance, thu=
s killing himself in the process,<br>
the he realized that the battery is a=
s good as the power station because<br>
the current is the same, so he beca=
me one with that, and then he went<br>
beyond and came back to guide as he =
was chosen, just like many others<br>
are, like my great teacher, guru nana=
k dev, Ramakrishna and all<br>
others=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6<br>
<br>
S=
tudent : And the source of the power station is?<br>
<br>
Teacher : The one=
- Satya shri akaal , he/she/it can't be put into words<br>
because he is in=
finite and the words are finite. It is purely on<br>
defining him religious=
 wars, riots between religions , and intellectual<br>
discussions and debat=
es on this thing called internet happen, but<br>
he/she/it is far beyond co=
mprehension. Many people focus on that , and<br>
get lost, but focus on the=
 power station (deity) and it will take you to<br>
big daddy.<br>
Imagine a=
n endless field of current in comparison of the power station ,<br>
an endl=
ess current which exists and all others are a figment of it. The<br>
power =
stations are a part of it, the current has taken the form of one<br>
concen=
trated zone.. But even this contains error of speech, so chuck it.<br>
The =
ultimate is only realized when you are one with the power station so<br>
le=
ts focus there.<br>
<br>
Student : So the one has taken forms of different =
power stations to help<br>
the batteries who are spread out to help unite b=
ack with it?<br>
<br>
Teacher : Brilliant.<br>
<br>
Student: So all our liv=
es we debate/fight and cut each other off to<br>
claim which power station =
(deity) is more powerful over the other and<br>
superior to all others, whe=
n in truth our eyes perceive them(deities) to<br>
be different, when they a=
re in essence one(Satya shri akaal) and<br>
laughing back at us?<br>
<br>
T=
eacher : ho ho ho=E2=80=A6.. Go on.<br>
<br>
Student : And we try to worshi=
p 10 different ones and always think that<br>
we should worship as many to =
get maximum benefit for our mistakingly<br>
confused identities of teddy , =
the car and all other toys?<br>
<br>
Teacher : *smokes slowly*=E2=80=A6 I a=
m listening.<br>
<br>
Student: So the biggest fools are those who are lost =
in debates and<br>
pseudo breathing in and out and raising kundalinis with =
peacock feathers<br>
and punches to the spine, reading stuff and debating o=
n concepts which<br>
they don't know a thing about?<br>
<br>
Teacher: Yes,S=
peaking of Kundalini, she is basically you, she is the<br>
battery. the stu=
pidest thing in the world is this concept of "my<br>
kundalini", err=E2=80=
=A6. you are her you idiot, how is she yours? Anyways ,<br>
many make this =
error, but it is essential because other wise you can't<br>
explain the con=
cept in speech. And if you do fully realize you are her,<br>
"you" will be =
phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets<br>
say a form, =
you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full<br>
glory . Whateve=
r you are worshipping is "you", who is without all the<br>
limitations of C=
haman/teddy/car/toy.<br>
<br>
Student: So then how do realized souls stay i=
n their bodies post their<br>
realization?<br>
<br>
Teacher: Intentional id=
entification with the personality by permission<br>
from the power station =
to fulfill some higher purpose of the power<br>
station to guide more batte=
ries to realize that they are not toys. But<br>
they can leave in an instan=
t, because they know realities that are much<br>
higher than our world.<br>=

<br>
Student : So what is moksha?<br>
<br>
Teacher : It is a concept that =
is best left alone, if you haven't merged<br>
back with a power station you=
rself first. You tell me when you have<br>
merged back, how do you know wha=
t if feels like to be merged back? You<br>
yourself have become one with yo=
ur source, so "you" don't remain, even<br>
the battery has dissolved, so ho=
w do "you" explain it? You wont remember<br>
it, because you are not there.=
<br>
<br>
Student : I can't explain it.<br>
<br>
Teacher : We can't, It is =
like explaining the color red to a blind man.<br>
You will say mars  is red=
 or the red light is red, he will say I have<br>
been blind from birth I do=
n't know what you are talking about. You will<br>
say tomato, he will say f=
uck off.<br>
<br>
Student : Yes, so It can't be explained.<br>
<br>
Teacher=
 : it can be to an extent, but it is one ridiculously convoluted<br>
topic.=
 To add to ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one toy is a car, one toy<br>
is a =
helicopter, one toy is a turtle, mind you battery is the same, but<br>
the =
car is very different form the toy, thus if you explain a high level<br>
co=
ncept to both, both will understand differently and have a go at it<br>
wit=
h debates and what not, which leads to more confusion. Better is both<br>
r=
ealize it themselves. So you focus on realizing that you are duracell<br>
f=
irst, mr chaman, everything else comes later. Thus, You are duracell.<br>
N=
ow time for my reward for my winning the bet. Dance naked on the road.<br>
=
<br>
Student : What?<br>
<br>
Teacher : You thought 4 times.<br>
<br>
Stude=
nt: But I will be disgraced.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Nope, Chaman will be, you a=
re duracell, they will laugh at<br>
Chaman, who is your 67432nd incarnation=
, you have done this thousand<br>
times before, so what??<br>
<br>
Student =
: I hate you.<br>
<br>
Teacher : I love you too.<br>
<br>
Student : You are=
 serious on this?<br>
<br>
Teacher : Very<br>
<br>
Student: : This is why s=
ome of the higher ones don't give a shit about<br>
roaming naked and doing =
wild stuff, just to keep people away from them.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Yes, but=
 a lot of frauds copy and disgrace the higher ones.<br>
<br>
Student : Fine=
, I will do it. But you will handle my parent's reaction.<br>
<br>
Teacher =
: Done.<br>
<br>
After the student did the act, nobody seemed to recall the=
 act the next<br>
day, yet every one saw it that day, and seemed to make fa=
ces at the<br>
student for an hour or so. How everybody forgot is a differe=
nt story<br>
altogether.<br>
<br>
Do sadhana, before your battery is pulled=
 out, replugged into another<br>
toy and yet again, your confusion will pre=
vail driving you to do things<br>
that will push you further and further do=
wn.<br>
<br>
Jai Shree Radheya!!<br>
