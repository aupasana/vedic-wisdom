Dear Narasimha,

Is there anything in the Vedas that encourage or prohibit =
the donation of organs upon death?  What impact, if any?

I realize that th=
is physical body is just one of the many vessels used by the atman in the c=
ycle of life and death. And I have also read that the subtle body is comple=
te, irregardless of any handicap of the person during "life" in this world.=


This is just my understanding, which maybe wrong.. if so please correct.
=


Warmest regards,
..
