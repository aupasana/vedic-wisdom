wha=

also do puja regularly and as one of our friends have suggested yes r=
ecite a particular stotra with its meaning known...doing this regularly aft=
er taking bath...will slowly ward it off...dont pay much heed...and if this=
 happens to you when you keep your eyes closed then keep it open while reci=
ting...
slowly you will develope concentration...
