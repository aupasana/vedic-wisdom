Dear Dolly,

It's wonderful to hear that you are starting your Purascharana=
 of the Panchakshara mantra of Lord Shiva the coming Monday. :) My best wis=
hes for your success, and I look forward to hearing from you as to how it w=
ent. 

I'm delighted to hear that you have agreed to be 'Purascharana buddi=
es'. :) 

Btw I came across your post on this forum, written sometime ago, =
regarding the TV program about Lord Shiva called Devon ke Dev Mahadev. 

I =
have become completely addicted to the program and have been learning about=
 Shiva's Lilas by watching it....the chorus "Mahadeva deva!" plays on in my=
 mind for ages after I finish watching, it's so addictive. I absolutely lov=
e it. 

Didn't know about Saawan being dear to Lord Shiva, but will certain=
ly be spending this holy month learning more about him via this program, an=
d doing some extra chanting of His Names. Thanks for writing about it here,=
 and 'accidentally' introducing me to it too. :) 

Hara Hara Mahadev! Prost=
rations to Shiva, Vishnu and Devi who are different wonderful forms of the =
same Divinity.  

Aparna
