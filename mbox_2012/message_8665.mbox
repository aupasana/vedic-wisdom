Aum Sri Ganesaya Namaha!

I want to say hello to the mailing list and than=
k Narasimha Ji and his
Guru for introducing the homam manuals. A few months=
 ago I was
considering buying some books on puja
instructions(http://www.sh=
reemaa.org/drupal/node/404
<http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/node/404>  ) and=
 I was thinking "it
would be great to do a homam but it's probably for very=
 experienced
sadhakas with the resources for it". Then, a few weeks later, =
while
searching for something else I stumbled upon Narasimha Ji's website. =
I
immediately thanked Lord Ganesa and Divine Mother and started reading.

I=
 have very little space to do a homam, but decided to try the
"super-short =
procedure". I couldn't find any copper item, so I used a
tiny glass contain=
er, and tiny pieces of coconut with lots of ghee being
poured. I have offer=
ed the 108 names of Lord Ganesha
('Vighneshvarashtottara Shatanamavalih' wh=
ich I took from the book
'Loving Ganesa' by Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami=

<http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/lg/lg_ch-12.html>  ),
and=
 soon I will move on to Ganapati AtharvaShirsha. I can definitely say
I've =
felt an upliftment, and a  'closeness' to Lord Ganesha after doing
it.

Now=
, my questions are:

1. How important is it to use a homa kundam? I have ve=
ry little space,
so the fire I can make is very small, so I have been think=
ing of using a
small copper container. (I think this is almost close to a '=
deepa homam'
as Narasimha Ji mentions here:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=
edic-wisdom/message/4369
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/messag=
e/4369>  )

2. For those not well-versed in Sanskrit, how important is the =
sadhaka's
understanding of the mantra(s)? For exmaple, let's assume that on=
e
hasn't learnt the meanings of all the 108 names of Lord Ganesha. Then is
=
it better to offer a simple mantra that you understand, like "Aum Sri
Ganes=
aya Namaha" so you can concentrate on the meaning while offering
it, rather=
 than offer mantras that you don't fully understand the
(literal)meaning ye=
t?

3. If you invoke the deities back into your heart and finish the
proced=
ure with 'Om Shanti Shanti Shanti' before the fire goes out, is it
ok to 's=
toke' the fire after that, to make sure everything burns as much
as possibl=
e?

4. Is it bad if there is some unburnt ghee or coconut left after
finish=
ing?

5. Considering Soumya vs. Ugra Devatas, how do we apply the distincti=
on
for the Navagrahas? Should we consider Shani, Mangala, Rahu, Ketu, (even=

Surya?) as Ugra Devatas? Since I'm probably doing a lot of things wrong
in=
 my procedure, I'm only planning to invoke Soumya Devatas.

6. If you are o=
ffering a single mantra many times, is there an easy way
to count the numbe=
r of repetitions?

Apologies for the long post, but hopefully someone can p=
rovide some
advice here. If they have already been answered, may be someone=
 can
point me to it.

Thanks,

Rohana
