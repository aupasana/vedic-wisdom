Hi Vikram,



1) If you are going for Rahu Ketu pooja , then go to only that temple 
and you should not visit any other temple while going and coming back.

2) Rahu ketu pooja which is done during rahukaal is considered most 
auspicious.

3) The best time preffered is After amavasya next coming 
Tuesday-rahukaal is the best time for that pooja.

4) You and your family (Who ever going there) should stay INSIDE temple 
for one night
before the pooja. (That means all of you should stay Monday night at 
temple.)

5) Note down the Rahukaal time on Tuesday, and be there in temple at 
least 1hr prior,
There will be a Que for pooja, stay in that Que, they will provide pooja 
materials buy them.

6) It is a very good experience, temple is very good, the environment 
inside temple is pleasant.

Enjoy!

Regards,
Suresha H

              <br>
              I am planning to visit Kalahasti temple during Aug'12 with
              my family and perform Rahu ketu, and Sarpa dosh pooja. I
              have read<br>
              on internet that after performing pooja one shouldn't
              visit any other temple and directly go to home/hotel.<br>
              I will follow this rule, but my doubt is --can we go to
              Tirupati temple first before going to Kalahasti temple?
              Pooja<br>
              at Kalahasti would be during rahu kalam- Sunday
              afternoon/evening, so can we visit Tirupati temple in
              Morning or<br>
              someone performing Kalahasti pooja should not go to any
              other temple before and after the pooja?<br>
              <br>
              I would appreciate all the suggestions/recommendations in
