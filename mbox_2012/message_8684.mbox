Namaste all,

Recently, I was party=
 to a conversation regarding an avatAr's supremacy over rishi and yOgi/jnAn=
i. My mental affiliations are closer to the yOga and advaita-vEdAnta philos=
ophies (needless to mention, the way I understand them). So far, based on m=
y affiliations and understanding, I'm of the opinion that a Realized Being =
(however he may have realized) is Divine in all its absoluteness (i.e. noth=
ing distinguishes them from The Divinity). The way I understand 'tat tvam a=
si', mOksha, Atma sAkshAtkAra, yOga, kaivalya, nirvANa etc. 

While their p=
rarabdha may have been different, once they are realized there is nothing t=
hat distinguishes them from what we call the Ultimate Divinity. So by logic=
al extension, an avatAr is just the re-incarnation of any Realized Being ir=
respective of that Being having attained to the Highest in 1 life, 10 lives=
, 100 lives or even a billion lives. Once they are Realized, their coming b=
ack in a future life is based on absolute free will and not by kArmic vAsan=
As that draw them to a womb. In a nutshell, I saw no reason to distinguish =
between Divine Descending (as an avatAr) vs. Man Ascending (as a Realized B=
eing). I was also forceful in the conversation that the entire Manifest Exi=
stence is Divine Descending and used that rationale to further fortify my p=
osition that if we discount effects of prArabdha/sanchita, a Human Ascended=
 yOgi/jnAni can(if willing) be as omnipotent/omniscient as a Divine Descend=
ed avatAr. The conversation ended with not much conclusion. 

The last few =
days, I had been revisiting this within myself a few times - specifically t=
he rationale for such classification in the below three eras. I'd like to h=
ear from the members on this forum regarding their understanding of an avat=
Ar, rishi, jnAni/yOgi etc. Please do mention the 'religious/spiritual tradi=
tion' you subscribe to, if possible. 


Ramayana Era - rAma/paraSu rAma (av=
atAr), vaSishTa/viSvAmitra/agastya (rishis), janaka/ashtAvakra/yAjnavalkya/=
rishyaSringa (jnAnis/yOgis)

Mahabharata Era - Krishna (avatAr), parASarA/v=
yAsa/Suka/paraSurAma (rishis), dharma vyadha(jnAni)

20th Century - Shirdi =
Sai (avatAr), ramaNa(rishi), rAma krishna(yOgi), Jiddu Krishnamurthi (jnAni=
)

Regards,
-Prasad

PS: I did ignore all bhaktas and many others who could=
 fall in the above categories. I just quoted one/two in each as that suffic=
es the subject of the discussion. Please don't take the discussion towards =
why some one else not mentioned here is or is not an avatAr/rishi/jnAi/yOgi=
 etc.
