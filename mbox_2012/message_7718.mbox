Dear friends,



I have visited the website www.vedicastrologer.org/ and=
 gone
through the details about honam. I still have few doubts and I will b=
e grateful
if it could be clarified.



1. what I found out was that, while=
 making any offering to
fire, swaha is to be added after any mantra and off=
ering is to be made to fire(
say om gam ganapataye namah swaha). Is it that=
 during hawan, we do charge the
offering(abhimantrit) with the mantra befor=
e we offer it to agni? In that case
do we have to first pick up the offerin=
g(coconut peice, seasum seeds, etc.) with
fingers, then chant the whole man=
tra with swaha and make the offering to agni.
Or we can pick up the hawan s=
amagri/offefing anytime in between chanting the
mantra but while saying swa=
ha offering to fire is to be made.=A0 



2. When should the material enter=
 agni? Is it with swaha or
after swaha? Is there any such guideline.



I h=
ad read in a book on yagya/hawan that the offering should
enter fire after =
swaha and that the offering reaching fire before swaha is
completed is cons=
idered in-auspicious. What I do during hawan is that I first pick
up the ha=
wan samagri in fingers, then chant whole mantra with swaha and then
only of=
fer it in fire. Is it right or I need to change?Kindly clarify.

=A0


I ha=
ve started doing ganapati hawan using your instruction
and I feel that mind=
 is more focused than what it used to be during jaap. Thank
you for you for=
 providing guidelines on hawan.

Thanking you,

=A0
