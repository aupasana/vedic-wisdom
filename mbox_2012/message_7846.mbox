Namaste Vasavi ji,

your such intense repentance is in itself sufficient fo=
r the "Praayaschit" of un-intended karma. it is my belief that intention is=
 the key. you never intended to eat beef and add to that you are so much de=
vastated after realising that you have eaten beef also makes that karma ver=
y light.

Eventhen if you need to really do something to satisfy your soul,=
 I suggest to spend coming MahaShivaratri (whole day tomorrow) in praying l=
ord shiva for the forgiveness for any bad karma incurred.
HE is Bholenath a=
nd your sincere prayers will be most definately heard.

Jay Bholenaatha!
