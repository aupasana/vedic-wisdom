Dear Ajitji,

I enjoyed reading your message- thank you. You are quite ri=
ght....it is important to stay put inside the 'elevator' until one reaches =
the final destination. I believe it is God's Grace alone that makes this po=
ssible, i.e. saves us from falling prey to temptations along the way. 

Sad=
hana and more sadhana....I agree. It is a long path, and is sometimes enjoy=
able, and sometimes dreary (especially when the destination seems far away =
because eliminating the six internal enemies seems so difficult)....but pes=
ervere we must. The sages say we are all destined for success one day or th=
e other- a heartening thought.

Speaking of destiny, this is a quotation I =
recently came across that I really like.

"Destiny is not a matter of chanc=
e; it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a th=
ing to be achieved." 
 
-William Jennings Bryan

ishes,

ered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a=
 pranam to the man and said, "Maharaj, please tell us some words of God". T=

nue with your lectures as you were doing before I came in". Everyone became=
 uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took=
 a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and started w=
alking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his f=
ollowers and said, "He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while,

 that ragged man and went out to see where the guy was going. As he approac=
hed the ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear E=
nglish, "Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me." X was of course=
 taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and more over he h=

y name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by professio=

sked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyenga=
r replied, "All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is source of =
all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary fo=
lks, really no one. And God is the reason for all the religious troubles an=

erness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu for long, th=
en how come you haven't met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?=
". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there is only one g=
enuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, merely different=
 degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not accessible t=
o others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The root of

s God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is=
 infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best =
a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-pow=
ers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this for=
m by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abi=
lities from this form, and generally be regarded by others as a man of god.=
 But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem is tryin=
g to understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing that one=
 has understood correctly." While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small tea=
-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chillum. The=
n held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smo=
ke in small bits. Then he continued, "You (meaning X) are a young man. Have=

better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realized w=

house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too com=
