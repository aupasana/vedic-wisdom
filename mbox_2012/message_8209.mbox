Dear Priya,

> I am interested in having my 11 yr old kid do homams
> is it=
 too early for me to teach homam.


Traditionally, agni is maintained start=
ing with the day of upanayana.
The brahmachari does the samidAdhAna homa tw=
ice daily. After marriage,
this changes to the aupAsana homa. Given that th=
e upanayana is usually
performed at a young age (8-12), our tradition expec=
ts children in
this age group to perform a simple homa.


> I know I am not=
 supposed to put anything inside the kunda.


The karmas of parent and chil=
d are strongly intertwined, especially
when the child is young and depends =
wholly on the parent. As it is,
you are already feeding his outward senses,=
 and are filling his
stomach. Putting something in the kunda in the beginni=
ng is fine. He
will quickly learn to do it for himself, in a matter of days=
.


> Will I be putting pressure on them .....
> shouldn't they experience =
the life in fullest form


Again, we can simply look at our tradition and i=
t's history. The
upanayana is performed in childhood, and these children co=
ntinued to
study and make wonderful contributions to society in many areas
=
(music, astrology, mathematics, poetry etc). They got married, had
children=
, become retired etc. However you define "experiencing life",
they probably=
 did it.

sasneham,

=A0 =A0ajit
