Dear Priyank,

If you ever were to develop an interest in Tantra, you would=
 do well to remember that nobody on the internet can teach you anything reg=
arding it. No websites, no blogs, no organizations, and specially not those=
 which are commercial. You may also come across some organizations which cl=
aim to provide, quite casually I may add, 'Mahavidya Sadhanas' for xyz mone=
y (where you maybe given a mantra and asked to chant the same for some days=
 after which you are entitled to claim you have completed xyz Mahavidya sad=
hana) , or merely by looking at a chart some mantra of some mahavidya is pr=
ovided and the individual chants the same for sometime and then believes he=
/she has done "mahavidya sadhana". All this is just a tamasha. Neither the =
people who run such organizations, nor their followers, have a clue.

Dear Rajarshi=

What you said makes perfect sense. That link i had given for general inf=

This is the kind of sadhana site =
