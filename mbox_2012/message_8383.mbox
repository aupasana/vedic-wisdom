Namaste,

Speaking of Goddess Chinnamasta, I recall a true incident. Let me=
 narrate the same here.


On his way to Gangotri, an individual named "P" r=
eached a small, less-populated village. It was evening and a slight drizzle=
 poured on the backdrop of a orange colored setting sun. He was wondering w=
here to spend the night, when he suddenly found a Bhairavi standing infront=
 of him. He was surprised. Shakti sadhana is not that popular in these part=
s of India, neither are Tantriks and Bhairavis. She wore a red sari, had a =
jata on her head and a trishul in one hand and small cloth tied into a knot=
 in her other hand. She looked about 32-34 years of age and was strikingly =
beautiful looking.


Before he could open his mouth, she started speaking a=
nd speaking. First she spoke in Hindi, then Punjabi and then Marathi. Becau=
se of his travels across India, the author was familiar with the sound of d=
ifferent Indian languages but could not understand them. Then she spoke in =
Bengali which was the P's mother-tongue. "Are you going to Gangotri? Have y=
ou found a place to stay for the night?". P was not too pleased seeing her.=
 He loved his own solitary wanderings and was not keen on company. So to av=
oid her, he said I have found a place to stay for the night but it is extre=
mely dirty, littered with droppings of wild animals and infested with snake=
s and scorpions. She insisted that she will be able to manage and it was af=
terall only a matter of one night to avoid the rains. Once the staying plac=
e was reached, she cleaned the place up with a fallen branch from a tree, l=
aid out her belongings on one side and lit a fire with some twigs. Then she=
 asked him if
 had any food. P replied he did not, plus all the shops in th=
e area were closed due to the inclement weather. She got up and said she ha=
s to take a bath in the Ganges nearby and will come back soon. After about =
half and hour she returned back with a something tied in a cloth. She opene=
d the cloth and took out 2 rotis and some bhaji and gave it to the author t=
o eat. The author was mildly surprised and on inquiry was told that near th=
e bank of Ganges she had found one small eatery and she got the food from t=
here. She herself did not eat anything but gave the food to the him, saying=
 she was not hungry. P felt grateful for the food and confessed that he wou=
ld have gone hungry tonight, had it not been for her, because he did not ha=
ve money to buy food. 


She asked with surprise, "You have come so far wit=
h any money? Where is your home? ETC ETC." On hearing his answers, she aske=
d, "So do you believe that your meeting me is due to the will of Jagadamba?=
".
He replied, "Well at least on regarding the food, definitely!"
Bhairavi,=
 "You people have petty minds, without any gains you don't listen to anythi=
ng, you don't interact freely with others".

He asked," Are you a Tantrik?"=
 She replied, "Yes. What is your bhava?"
P, "I do not have fixed path, but =
I am very curious about Tantra and Shakti Sadhana. Can you ask you some que=
stions about Tantra? Can a person attain God through the path of Tantra?"

=

She sat down crosslegged in padmasana and replied, " The word God means di=
fferent things to different people. Then attaining God has even more differ=
ent and complex meanings to everyone based on their own ideas. This is not =
like attaining some property or money. It can be attained by various path, =
and then again it can attained by no-path at all. And the most complex thin=
g in all this is what you refer to as God is not something that is to be po=
ssessed at all! Are you satisfied with the answer?"

P: "What is the aim of=
 Tantrik sadhanas? What is the tangible benefit? Those who are Tantriks or =
Siddha Kaulacharis, what do they gain?"

Bhairavi, "Whoever does sadhana wi=
th whatever intention, they will achieve that. But real Tantra-sadhana, whi=
ch is vira-chara, is about becoming free from chains (pashas). Only when th=
e chains have been broken that divine Shakti is awakened in the body. Now i=
f someone then uses this Divine Shakti for personal gains, then they head t=
owards great calamity. Those who use it for the good of humanity, they beco=
me really divine".

Till now she was speaking calmly. Now P asked, "But the=
 answer that you gave seems like a riddle to me. Are you trying to imply th=
at man cannot attain God through Tantra?"

Bhairavi:"If you had been intell=
igent, you would not have asked this question. Forget about attaining God f=
or the moment, first learn to acquire shakti. Have you done that? Start imm=
ediately and by Bhagawati's grace you will accomplish. This I can guarantee=
.=C2=A0 First become a Shaktiman, understand what is Shakti and how much Sh=
akti you are capable of holding in your body and mind. Understood? Don't wa=
ste your time in useless debates. Did you understand what I am saying?"

Th=
e Bhairavi looked angry, the color of her face has suddenly changed and her=
 eyes become still and unblinking. P felt scared. He kept quite. She contin=
ued:" All these idiots having read a few books here and there have only lea=
rnt useless debates and time-wasting. Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Sha=
ktihin (sans Shakti), medhahin (sans intellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you =
guys get kicked from your bosses in office, and the come home and show off =
your impotency on your wives and mothers. And you want to debate on Shakti =
sadhana! This is ridiculous!"

P got unnerved and was certain that she is a=
 mad woman. The moment this thought came in his mind, she stood up at a lig=
htning pace and screamed back, " Oh you think I am mad? You don't know who =
I am. I can destroy you completely, or I can make you into a real Shaktiman=
. Do you want to see?"

His mind became stunned into silence. He did not kn=
ow what to say. In fear, he looked down at his own feet unable to make any =
conversation and started chanting the name of Krishna to save him. He wonde=
red if he should now get up and run away from that place. Immediate she cam=
e over to where he was sitting and held his shoulders, "Where will you run?=
 Do you think you have the ability to escape from me, without my willing it=
? I consider people like you nothing more than insects. You've left your wi=
fe and son and gone out roaming to peform Dharma! You don't even know what =
Dharma means. An idiot of the first order. People like you are sheep, not m=
en. Escapists and cowards. Throw away all your bookish adwaitha into the Ga=
nges. It's nonsense. Either do you know what is bhoga, nor do you know what=
 is yoga, running away from life and believing that by escaping one attains=
 to renunciation. No passion for life, no passion for God. Dead decayed ind=
ividuals. A sheep
 whose only contribution to life is to reproduce some mor=
e sheep and then run away from them. Idiot!"

In fear and shame the P felt =
like he would faint any moment. For the first time in his wanderings he fel=
t so depressed about himself that he did not know what to say. Like in a tr=
ance he felt his 

vision was becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fal=
l down on the floor, when the Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his sho=
ulders and said, "There is no renunciation or detachment from life in your =
heart and mind. How dare you argue and dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha await=
s you and you think you can escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Ar=
e you free from desires of life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through y=
ou". He could not lift his eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt asha=
med of himself and in a feeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her fee=
t and started crying, "Ma please save me.=C2=A0 You are right. I am an idio=
t, I am a coward, I am an escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and=
 children at home. I am weak of mind and heart." His voice became choked wi=
th tears.

Hearing this the Bhairavi became silent. She held his chin with =
her right-hand and lifted up his face to the light. Her eyes had changed co=
lor and there was a tremendous compassion on her face. "What do you think I=
 am? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from hell to torment you, a raving=
 mad woman?"


And P replied, "But I have not said anything to you like tha=
t, have I?". Hearing this she became furious with anger, "Will you people n=
ever become real men? You think something in your heart and you lie through=
 your teeth when asked. Don't you have any tej, shakti anything at all? Lyi=
ng to escape situations? Is this the character of real purush? Soft like mu=
d who can be molded into any obnoxious character when challenged by situati=
ons? And you think you can learn vira-bhava of Bhairava? Fool! What do you =
do in life?"

P replied he was a painter before he left home. Hearing this =
her eyes widened in a childlike excitement. She lost her anger completely a=
nd asked," Can you draw me a picture? I have been searching for a good arti=
st? Can you draw a picture of Chinnamasta? I've not found anyone who can dr=
aw her properly".

P, "Printed pictures of Chinnamasta are easily available=
 in the market for a very little price". Hearing this she started roaring w=
ith laughter, "Printed in the markets you say? Hah! Chinnamasta? 

Have you=
 gone mad? <again laughter>."

P, "I find her image very violent and terrif=
ying".

Then the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud that it sounded like a h=
umkar, "Fool! For people like you who are worst than women, it is but natur=
al that Chinnamasta will look scary and terrifying. People who are scared a=
t the first sight of blood and death will not appreciate her beauty! Those =
who remain trapped in conditioned thinking of pap vs punya, sarga vs naraka=
, good vs bad, and other dualities cannot understand the madness of Chinnam=
asta. You will only be able to draw a white Saraswati with her beena and li=
ve trying to deny the other aspects and realities of life, the death and th=
e decay and never see the grand play of the Universe. For you and your ilk,=
 a woman is an object of subconscious revulsion, you run scared when you se=
e the first woman approaching, you run away from your own wife, how on eart=
h can you handle the terrible beauty of Chinnamasta?"

Then she pushed him =
with her hand. He fell on the floor. She continued, "Go drown yourself in t=
he Ganges and before doing so pray to Jagadamba Durga that She may make you=
 fit to hold shakti in your next life. Or at least beg Her, implore Her, th=
at She may grant you intelligence to understand what is Shakti-tattwa."

He=
aring these words, P was so depressed that his mind plunged into chaos and =
darkness. Like in a state of debilitating trance, he got up from the floor =
and sat down. The Bhairavi was not there in the room. He looked all around =
him. Then he saw her on the road outside, walking towards the ganges. He cr=
ied out to her, "Don't leave me here, I must know who you are. I am confuse=
d about life and everything else". As soon as he uttered these words, the r=
oom started reverberating with a attahasa, though there was not a soul pres=
ent there apart from him. A laughter so loud that he left his ear drums wil=
l split. He rushed out into the rain to follow the moving figure of the Bha=
iravi. The faster he ran, the more did the distance keep increasing between=
 him and the Bhairavi. Then he could see clearly, the Bhairavi entering int=
o the Ganges water, and kept moving deeper until she was drowned completely=
 in the water. The author sat near the banks, shouting out to her,
 asking =
her to come out and help him. But there was no response. Just the regular l=
apping sound of waves hitting the shore and a very dark night. 


He sat th=
ere till sunrise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. Next morning he wen=
t and asked around the village, but no one had seen the Bhairavi and neithe=
r was there any shop near the banks which sold food. Because of the heavy r=
ains, everything was shut down last night with not a soul in the open.


Ye=
ars later, P went back home to his wife and son and lead a full and complet=
e family life. I have merely narrated the incident as it is.

Hello, 
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 This letter is to cheer you up and it is=C2=A0a strange but tr=
ue personal experience.
Divine Mother cares and protects her children all t=
he time and also plays snakes and ladders and ludo with them. Bhagvati Sri =
Chinnmastaji is one of Dash MahaVidya and Her Swroop is very difficult to l=
ook at for me. Her Appearence Day Tithi has just gone by few weeks ago.
=C2=
=A0
Many years ago when I was living in Brajbhoomi, a sadhu came one late e=
vening to my ashram. After some time he took me to a quite corner and told =
me certain thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had a glow on his face a=
nd had certain powers about him I believed him. Later on he also gave me a =
Mantra of=C2=A0Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu left in the morni=
ng and I never saw him again. Somehow the things he told me did not happen =
and this tithi became very upsetting for me.
=C2=A0
Some years back here in=
 London I was coming home in the afternoon. I was in a crowded bus and hold=
ing on to railings.Suddenly I rememberd that it was Tithi of Bhagvati Sri C=
hinnmastaji. I started to recite Her mantra\name and try to meditate on Her=
 in that crowded bus. I even smiled myself on the strangeness of that situa=
tion. After few more minutes I reached home and opened my front door and we=
nt inside. After going through my Puja room and telling my mother that I wa=
s back, I flopped on sofa in front room which is very near to front gate. T=
hen I heard some noises but I did not get up and slept for nearly one hour.=
 After I got up I got a srrong feeling to open my front door although nobod=
y had knocked. The whole area in front of my house was covered in Police li=
nes and tapes. I could not believe it. 
=C2=A0
I asked a policeman who was =
near my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were shooting at each other an=
d then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that day I was clearly save=
d by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner sky several minutes be=
fore the incident and I started Her prayers although there was no reasons f=
or me to do so. Then I slept whole time without knowing a single thing as l=
oad of armed policemen were there after those gunman.and whole noises and d=
rama.
What else is this but Personal Grace of Bhagvati Sri=C2=A0Chinnmastaj=

Namaste 


Aparna ji, afew of us whom you consider are blessed wi=
th the desire to pray her may definitely feel bad to read your mail. The wa=
ys of god are very mysterious and we humans especially in this yug have no =
right to ask her ruling. Calling god "damn" hurts especially for those who =
pray her like parents. If you don't like god please keep your feelings towa=
rds yourself as this forum is not meant for those who hate god.The=C2=A0 ma=
il that nobody ji has written is for those who already pray him not for new=
comers who have to yet develop love/affection/trust for god...=C2=A0=C2=A0
=

As I write this I show no hatred towards you or those people who talk in s=
imilar fashion. It is their ignorance and the soul transformation doesn't h=
appen easily. Hence I will definitely pray for your inner growth. 


Nobody=
 ji has spoken thousand words of wisdom hats off to his thoughts.=C2=A0 Whe=
n I went to learn car driving the teacher saw me driving with no attention.=
 He yelled at me and I learnt driving in one day. Some students don't liste=
n when explained gently, some students listen only when the teacher yells s=
o no offences should be taken by anyone.=C2=A0 


Another thing I always no=
ticed is that for some reason most of them in this forum talk with great re=
spect to Narsimha ji and don't even consider taking advices given by any ot=
her devotees. We all know Narsimha ji but we don't know which other high ra=
ised souls we are talking to. Please talk with respect and consideration to=
wards other devotees also otherwise our prayers are a complete waste....

 Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Shaktihin (sans Shakti), medhahin (sans =
intellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you guys get kicked from your bosses in o=
ffice, and the come home and show off your impotency on your wives and moth=
ers. And you want to debate
 on Shakti sadhana! This is ridiculous!"</div><=
div><br></div><div>P got unnerved and was certain that she is a mad woman. =
The moment this thought came in his mind, she stood up at a lightning pace =
and screamed back, " Oh you think I am mad? You don't know who I am. I can =
destroy you completely, or I can make you into a real Shaktiman. Do you wan=
t to see?"</div><div><br></div><div>His mind became stunned into silence. H=
e did not know what to say. In fear, he looked down at his own feet unable =
to make any conversation and started chanting the name of Krishna to save h=
im. He wondered if he should now get up and run away from that place. Immed=
iate she came over to where he was sitting and held his shoulders, "Where w=
ill you run? Do you think you have the ability to escape from me, without m=
y willing it? I consider people like you nothing more than insects. You've =
left your wife and son and gone out roaming to peform Dharma! You don't eve=
n know what Dharma
 means. An idiot of the first order. People like you are=
 sheep, not men. Escapists and cowards. Throw away all your bookish adwaith=
a into the Ganges. It's nonsense. Either do you know what is bhoga, nor do =
you know what is yoga, running away from life and believing that by escapin=
g one attains to renunciation. No passion for life, no passion for God. Dea=
d decayed individuals. A sheep whose only contribution to life is to reprod=
uce some more sheep and then run away from them. Idiot!"</div><div><br></di=
v><div>In fear and shame the P felt like he would faint any moment. For the=
 first time in his wanderings he felt so depressed about himself that he di=
d not know what to say. Like in a trance he felt his <br></div><div>vision =
was becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fall down on the floor, when =
the Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his shoulders and said, "There is=
 no renunciation or detachment from life in your heart and mind. How dare y=
ou argue and
 dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha awaits you and you think you c=
an escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Are you free from desires o=
f life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through you". He could not lift hi=
s eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt ashamed of himself and in a f=
eeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her feet and started crying, "Ma=
 please save me.  You are right. I am an idiot, I am a coward, I am an=
 escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and children at home. I am w=
eak of mind and heart." His voice became choked with tears.</div><div><br><=
/div><div>Hearing this the Bhairavi became silent. She held his chin with h=
er right-hand and lifted up his face to the light. Her eyes had changed col=
or and there was a tremendous compassion on her face. "What do you think I =
am? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from hell to torment you, a raving =
mad woman?"<br></div><div><br></div><div>And P replied, "But I have not sai=
d
 anything to you like that, have I?". Hearing this she became furious wit=
h anger, "Will you people never become real men? You think something in you=
r heart and you lie through your teeth when asked. Don't you have any tej, =
shakti anything at all? Lying to escape situations? Is this the character o=
f real purush? Soft like mud who can be molded into any obnoxious character=
 when challenged by situations? And you think you can learn vira-bhava of B=
hairava? Fool! What do you do in life?"</div><div><br></div><div>P replied =
he was a painter before he left home. Hearing this her eyes widened in a ch=
ildlike excitement. She lost her anger completely and asked," Can you draw =
me a picture? I have been searching for a good artist? Can you draw a pictu=
re of Chinnamasta? I've not found anyone who can draw her properly".</div><=
div><br></div><div>P, "Printed pictures of Chinnamasta are easily available=
 in the market for a very little price". Hearing this she started
 roaring =
with laughter, "Printed in the markets you say? Hah! Chinnamasta? <br></div=
><div>Have you gone mad? <again laughter>."</div><div><br></div><div>=
P, "I find her image very violent and terrifying".</div><div><br></div><div=
>Then the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud that it sounded like a humkar, =
"Fool! For people like you who are worst than women, it is but natural that=
 Chinnamasta will look scary and terrifying. People who are scared at the f=
irst sight of blood and death will not appreciate her beauty! Those who rem=
ain trapped in conditioned thinking of pap vs punya, sarga vs naraka, good =
vs bad, and other dualities cannot understand the madness of Chinnamasta. Y=
ou will only be able to draw a white Saraswati with her beena and live tryi=
ng to deny the other aspects and realities of life, the death and the decay=
 and never see the grand play of the Universe. For you and your ilk, a woma=
n is an object of subconscious revulsion, you run scared
 when you see the =
first woman approaching, you run away from your own wife, how on earth can =
you handle the terrible beauty of Chinnamasta?"</div><div><br></div><div>Th=
en she pushed him with her hand. He fell on the floor. She continued, "Go d=
rown yourself in the Ganges and before doing so pray to Jagadamba Durga tha=
t She may make you fit to hold shakti in your next life. Or at least beg He=
r, implore Her, that She may grant you intelligence to understand what is S=
hakti-tattwa."</div><div><br></div><div>Hearing these words, P was so depre=
ssed that his mind plunged into chaos and darkness. Like in a state of debi=
litating trance, he got up from the floor and sat down. The Bhairavi was no=
t there in the room. He looked all around him. Then he saw her on the road =
outside, walking towards the ganges. He cried out to her, "Don't leave me h=
ere, I must know who you are. I am confused about life and everything else"=
. As soon as he uttered these words, the room
 started reverberating with a=
 attahasa, though there was not a soul present there apart from him. A laug=
hter so loud that he left his ear drums will split. He rushed out into the =
rain to follow the moving figure of the Bhairavi. The faster he ran, the mo=
re did the distance keep increasing between him and the Bhairavi. Then he c=
ould see clearly, the Bhairavi entering into the Ganges water, and kept mov=
ing deeper until she was drowned completely in the water. The author sat ne=
ar the banks, shouting out to her, asking her to come out and help him. But=
 there was no response. Just the regular lapping sound of waves hitting the=
 shore and a very dark night. <br></div><div><br></div><div>He sat there ti=
ll sunrise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. Next morning he went and =
asked around the village, but no one had seen the Bhairavi and neither was =
there any shop near the banks which sold food. Because of the heavy rains, =
everything was shut down last night
 with not a soul in the open.</div><div=
><br></div><div><br></div><div>Years later, P went back home to his wife an=
d son and lead a full and complete family life. I have merely narrated the =
incident as it is.<br></div><div><br></div><div>-Regards</div><div> Ra=

<div><span>Some years back here in London I was coming home in the af=

 myself on the strangeness of that situation. After few more minutes I reac=
hed home and opened my front door and went inside. After going through my P=
uja room and telling my mother that I was back, I flopped on sofa in front =
room which is very near to front gate. Then I heard some noises but I did n=
ot get up and slept for nearly one hour. After I got up I got a srrong feel=
ing to open my front door although nobody had knocked. The whole area in fr=
ont of my house was covered in Police lines and tapes. I could not believe =
it. </span></div>
<div><span></span> </div>
<div><span>I asked a polic=

each other and then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that day I was=
 clearly saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner sky sever=
