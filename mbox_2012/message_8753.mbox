Very interesting. I wish this brave doctor luck....it is not easy to talk o=
f these subjects before fellow scientists, doctors and lay people due to th=
e scorn and ridicule that is poured upon one. Not to mention doubts about o=
ne's sanity and commitment to science.

There is no divorce between science=
 and religion. As Sivananda said "they are twins"....both seek the truth. 
=

The marvels of the universe unravelled by science, ranging from the incred=
ible design of the human body and the beauty in nature, the precision of th=
e laws of nature....with each new scientific discovery, one is filled with =
awe at the sheer intelligence in nature, and for the creator. 

I attended =
a teaching session on spinal cord injuries at my workplace yesterday. We re=
vised the anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord. Once again, as I alway=
s am when I study the human body, I was wonderstruck by the sheer intellige=
nce of design. Every ligament, every bone....arranged perfectly to protect =
and preserve this delicate vital structure called the spinal cord. The huma=
n body is filled with examples for incredible design, and so is the whole o=
f nature.

If the creation is so intelligent and beautiful, one cannot help=
 but ask....what must the creator be like? Who made all this stuff? And why=
? These questions can only be answered by the creator himself.

And here en=
ds the realm of the intellect and modern science, and here begins the realm=
 of spirituality and religion. The search for the creator.


Om Prakrityai =
Namaha.

Aparna
