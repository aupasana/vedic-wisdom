A good resource for this is
http://www.vedicgranth.org/what_are_vedic_granth/the-four-veda/rig-ved

The "VedicGranth.Org - RigVed.zip" link on this page has a nice excel
spreadsheet which lists all the mantras, along with the devatas and rishis.
Those who are familiar with excel can use filtering to quickly find mantras
by a given rishi on a particular devata.

Note: The creator of this spreadsheet has "locked" the sheet, which
disables filtering. Copy the content to a new excel spreadsheet, and you
can then filter the column content.

sasneham,

   ajit
