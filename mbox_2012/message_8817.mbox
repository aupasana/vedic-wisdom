Namaste,

In my opinion, knowing a mantra of a mantra-shastra is one thing,=
 being able to apply the same is another thing altogether.

Quite possibly,=
 the science of mantras, as it used to be is lost. Parts exist but many cla=
uses and sub-clauses are finished. Moreover, what passes off as mantra-shas=
tra today - in most cases - is frankly only partial knowledge and doubtful =
how accurate the rules really are.

The original science of Mantras-shastra=
 involved being able to create a mantra for a specific purpose, and a thoro=
ugh knowledge of precise effects of different well-known mantras. Or even t=
o look at a new mantra and understand how it works.


Many famous mantras s=
till exist, but the science of creating new mantra that will have efficacy =
is almost gone.=C2=A0 There are no people of that spiritual caliber. For it=
 is not just a science like mathematics - pure reason - but also needs a tr=
emendous and directed force from the soul to make the jump between a mere c=
ollection of sounds to a mantra that causes perceivable effects. No easy jo=
b. 


A mantra, to be of any genuine use, must have certain key components =
in place. The pronunciation, ritualistic-rules (for those which require it,=
 example some Tantrik mantras) and (MOST Important) the right kind of mind =
which chants the mantra. The last is vital and for most mantras the key the=
 separates success and failure of using a mantra. By right kind of mind, it=
 is understood that first the mind must learn to become still. No fluctuati=
on of thoughts. No running commentary that goes on incessantly in normal ca=
se. ONLY then the mantra will vibrate will full impact in the system and ca=
use and effect. Otherwise it just remains a mundane repetition - which is g=
ood too as a preparation for a stage when the mind learn to become still. I=
nitially it happens for very brief time-frames, then for longer periods. In=
 a very high stage a person can instill that kind of movement-less mind at =
all times and function from a different perspective. Not just mantras, but
=
 any sadhana in general bears fruits only when there is some stillness in t=
he mind. To achieve which first there has to be still-ness in various parts=
 of the body - physical body, pranamaya-kosha (no craving, desires, wants, =
attraction/repulsion this/that etc), and then the manomaya-kosha (the mind =
which constructs concepts/logic/reason to understand the world). All the th=
ree koshas influence what we call in general terms as the mind. So all thes=
e parts of the human being have to imbibe stillness, learn to stay calm and=
 to bring about a sthiti in the "mind", and then a mantra, specially higher=
 mantras, show their effects. Any disturbance of any of the koshas prohibit=
s a mantra to work properly.

In the mantras from the Vedas, it takes the s=
cience of creating mantras to one more higher level. A perfect fusion of 
r=
ight swara, right phonetics and a powerful thrust from a very high 
conscio=
usness, that does not function as normal minds do by adding steps in logica=
l bits and pieces. And these three work in such a tandem and 
natural flow =
that one cannot be separated from the others. Hence the 
mantras of the Ved=
as have multilayer effects. They have a philosophical 
effect, a karmic eff=
ect that works in the astral planes as cause and 
effect, and an effect in =
spiritual planes called the karana-jagat. Of 
course, to realize the full i=
mpact of the Vedic mantras, the person 
doing the chanting too must have ma=
de considerable progress inside his/her 
being.

In non-vedic mantras, swar=
a is not that important. For their effects are also not as multidimensional=
 as vedic mantras. All mantras are difficult to realize, vedic mantras more=
 so.

Every letter of the Sanskrit alphabet creates a vibration in some par=
t of some chakra or in another terminology, some part of some of the koshas=
, or all the koshas. Some mantras are designed specifically for achieving s=
ome material impact on the phsyical world. They may not have any spiritual =
impact. For such mantras to show effects, consciously or unconsciously the =
person chanting a mantra has to learn to divert a part of his/her own shakt=
i of the pranamaya-kosha through the mantra into the larger universe of the=
 pranamayakosha, which in turn will cause an impact in the world around us =
as we recognize it.=C2=A0 The pranamaya kosha has the most direct bearing o=
n this world as we known it. A large part of the Tantras deal with such kin=
d of mantras and rituals are aimed to use the pranamaya-kosha for affecting=
 various mundane results.


Then there are mantras which take a sadhaka int=
o the Vijyanamaya kosha beyond the thinking, conceptualizing mind into the =
causal plane. These are very conducive for genuine spiritual progress. Many=
 of the mantras of higher deities are of this kind. However, to the get the=
 full impact of these mantras again lot of internal preparation is needed, =
for without preparation it is impossible to push the normal mind into these=
 layers. Moreover it is not just the mind that must enter into these real s=
piritual planes, but even the pranamaya-kosha must also be lifted up to the=
se planes. This lifting of the pranamayakosha of a person is preceded by a =
releasing of it normal functions - holding the frontal personality together=
***. In another language this is termed as releasing the Kundalini and risi=
ng it upwards. Every time the pranamaya-kosha goes up to meet the energies =
of the spiritual plane, it also bring down a bit of those energies by assoc=
iation as it falls
 back. Incessantly done, it can eventually spiritualize =
and transform the ordinary waking consciousness. A grand and worthy aim.


=
But the bottomline remains, to use any mantra to its full benefit need lots=
 of preparation. Rarely is it a one day job. A first vital step is to imbib=
e and instill a calmness in the whole being, which can lead to a stillness =
that is conducive for the mantra to show its real effects and let the body-=
mind assimilate the same.



*** How and in what exact proportion and manne=
r the pranamayakosha of a person is released from its normal functions will=
 vary from one sadhak to another. Just no hard fast rule. It can break off =
completely [from its ordinary engagements] in one shot in day one. Or it ca=
n break of in parts and keep pushing up, eventually and if destined, for th=
e whole of it to get released from the job of integrating the surface perso=
nality.
