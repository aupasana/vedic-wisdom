Hello,
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0That is official standard reply for everyone who =
ask such questions. After all there are many others who ask same things
I w=
ill try to write few things which I did myself. May be it will help you.

1=
--- Everything works because of Divine Grace. It is not our japa, tapa, hav=
en or other spiritual work which is cause of Darshan. No, it is Divine Grac=
e which shows us the path. Everything comes under it.
2-- Are you doing any=
 pranayam or breathing exercises on a regular basis. Rebirthing exercise is=
 lot like sudershankriya but much softer. Doing this or others will clear t=
he nadis in the body and will bring new light even once a week.

3--- Are y=
ou doing any meditations in your very busy and responsible life. =A0Yoga ni=
dra is a very good meditation and many times combining breathing exercises =
and meditations even in 10/15 days works wonder.

4--- I hope very much tha=
t you have a focus of your japa like a Beautiful Picture of Divine Lord.

5=
--- Next time you go to Rishikesh, try to do some japa standing in SriGanga=
ji after doing prayers to Her. But please do not take any risks. When I did=
 it on opposite bank, in month of December people kept a eye on me. Being a=
 woman brings it own problem if there is no man there to support. But you d=
o not have to do it if you do not want it.

6---You might notice feeling of=
 sex increases as the japa increases. It is a very difficult problem. You a=
re a lucky person because you have women teachers in your ashram with whom =
you could talk. It is not that you need any advise because people come to y=
ou for that. But it is a very difficult problem to deal with in spiritual l=
ife

7---Please do not put blockage by saying that you want Darshan even wi=
th inner eye. Let Them decide. After all you want to see Them and They want=
 to see you.=A0

8--- Relax. I hope you are not in any physical pain apart =
from longing for Darshan. So take things easy. Let the spiritual energy slo=
wly build up. Things will happen, Look for Divine Grace.

There are several=
 other things which I did. I am sure you will also know.

LaxmiNarayan

Hi LaxmiNarayanji=
,

I recently asked a senior monk at the Sivananda Ashram in Rishikesh as t=
o whether it is possible to have Darshan of Narayana i.e. see Him in the fo=
rm described in all our scriptures with 4 arms, holding the conch, discus, =
mace and lotus. I said to him, there are countless stories of devotees havi=
ng Darshan of their God, is it actually possible today, in this day and age=
?

He said, yes most certainly! But he said Darshan of God means feeling th=
e Divine Presence in yourself, and all things, living and non-living, in ev=
ery atom, everywhere. This, he said, is Darshan.

I am continuing with japa=
 in the hope of one day getting to this stage of feeling the presence of Go=
d everywhere at all times. 

However, having said that, I have not given up=
 the idea of 'seeing' God (may be with the 'inner eye') in the form of Vish=
nu and Krishna- yes, with mace, discus, flute and all!!

The Bhagavatam say=
s that Dhruva, Prahlad, even the elephant king Gajendra saw Vishnu....then =
why not me?!! Of course I'll have to do a lot of japa, a lot of sadhana, re=
move all negative emotions, become a paragon of virtue (Oh god!) but I beli=
eve that if I do, it's bound to happen. May take a few lifetimes though (bu=
t I'm going to try and do it this time, you've got to try at least!).

If u=
lta Rama nama could transform rogue Ratnakar into saint Valmiki, and grant =
him Darshan of Sri Rama, then why cannot Om NamoNarayana convert rogue Apar=
na into saint Aparna one day and give her Darshan of Vishnu/Krishna....I be=
lieve that the mantra can do anything. Anything. We'll all be saints one da=
y....ain't got no choice, He'll see to it. :)

Thanks for the message. :)

=
Aparna

 I still cannot understand why it is wrong to have a spiritual exp=
eriences or to think about them. After all we cannot go to a shop and just =
buy them. If we are doing <span id=3D"misspell-48" class=3D"mark">sadhana</=
span> and we need support they are going to happen. Why deny them? Suppose =
someone is doing the complete <span id=3D"misspell-49" class=3D"mark">pursc=
haran</span>  of mantra, is to wrong  not to expect something ama=
zing might happen at the end of it.<br>> <br>> Some years ago there w=
as a Hindi author who was well off and had a Temple in their home for sever=
al generations. Something happened in this authors life and he felt lot of =
trauma and could not find mental peace. In his later life he took up doing =
prayers and <span id=3D"misspell-50" class=3D"mark">japa</span> etc as he w=
as taught in his younger days. One night his daughter said to him, you are =
doing so much prayers etc, have you had any experiences.<br>> <br>> T=
he author
 became upset and said, no, he had not any experiences. Many time=
s he thinks that he is siting in front of a stone in the temple and it is a=
ll useless. But he will not give up his prayers as his time is coming neare=
r.<br>> Next morning when this author was in his Temple and priest was d=
oing <span id=3D"misspell-51" class=3D"mark">ManglaAarti</span>, The Deity<=
br>> Spoke to him and comforted him.<br>> <br>>  Several days=
 later when he went to a famous Temple in <span id=3D"misspell-52" class=3D=
"mark">Rajasthan</span>, again the Divine Lord spoke to him there and comfo=
rted him and said there is no difference between Him and Deities in his hom=
e Temple.<br>> <br>> When I read this story I knew immediately it was=
 a true story. Very similar things have happened with me to help me and com=
fort me. <br>> <br>> We are going from A to B. Is it a relentles=
s journey? Are there no breaks, petrol stations or shops where we can get o=
ut and
 stretch ourselves. Are there any road signs. Spiritual experiences =
are like these. They guide us and show us if we are on a right path.<br>>=
; <br>> I was thinking of writing to this devotee who had this powerful =
experience in Temple. Please write about it. What you experienced and what =
really happened. It will give knowledge to others. But then I realised that=
 I am a lone ranger here and many times go against the stream.<br>> <br>=
>  Many people are very young here and take <span id=3D"misspell-53=
" class=3D"mark">NarasimhaBhai</span> as their guru or spiritual adviser. S=
o if <span id=3D"misspell-54" class=3D"mark">guruji</span> is saying someth=
ing, <span id=3D"misspell-55" class=3D"mark">chela</span> and clients canno=
t go against it. <span id=3D"misspell-56" class=3D"mark">Othewise</span> th=
eir fire-pot, ghee-pot and coco-pot will be confiscated. <br>> <br>=
> I was also like this in my life. I took <span id=3D"misspell-57"
 clas=
s=3D"mark">diksha</span>  from my Late Uncle who was famous in his day=
s.<br>> When I tried to talk to him about <span id=3D"misspell-58" class=
=3D"mark">Darshan</span> of Divine Lord, he became very negative and said i=
t is not possible. I kept very quite. I did not try to give examples of sai=
nts like <span id=3D"misspell-59" class=3D"mark">Tulsidas</span> or others =
who had <span id=3D"misspell-60" class=3D"mark">Darshan</span>. I had not d=
one any spiritual <span id=3D"misspell-61" class=3D"mark">sadhana</span> an=
d so no personal experiences.<br>> . <br>> Since then my life ha=
s changed due to different spiritual experiences. Sure I am still in lot of=
 pain and not in a complete bliss all the the time but I know Divine Beings=
 can very easily give <span id=3D"misspell-62" class=3D"mark">Darshan</span=
> And having spiritual experiences are very helpful for spiritual growth.<b=
