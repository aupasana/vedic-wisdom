Knowledge of scri=
ptures might bring a sense of accomplishment and happiness
but unless our a=
ttitude is flawless and our conscience clear, it will be
hard to achieve st=
eadfastness and bliss. ****

** **

How much ever one is well versed in the=
 Vedas, Upanishads and the Bhagavad
Gita -- and even if one has shlokas at =
his finger tips, he must possess
control over his senses, limit his desires=
 and contemplate on the knowledge
he has, to attain spiritual progress. Rav=
ana had unmatched knowledge but
his attitude was not good. ****

** **

The=
 continuous chain of trials and tribulations of various degrees of
magnitud=
e in life could help a seeker understand the meaning and purpose of
life. A=
n ignorant person blames either God or Destiny or even more so his
family a=
nd friends for all that happens to him. ****

** **

A man wants his young =
son to learn swimming. He takes him to the nearby
lake to give him lessons =
on how to swim. He first ties an inflatable tube
to his waist, so that it l=
ets him float. After some days the boy is
familiar with the up thrust got b=
y the arm cycle and leg kick, and he
experiences buoyancy. When the father =
is confident that the boy can float
without the help of the tube, he remove=
s it and lets the boy swim without
the help of the tube. An inflatable swim=
ming tube only helps the boy to
remain afloat on the surface of the water; =
it only assisted him in learning
how to swim. Likewise, scriptures help us =
to get a vision; we get a vivid
account of the glory and splendor of the om=
nipresence, omniscience and
omnipotence of the Absolute Truth. However, ult=
imately we can progress on
the spiritual path only by our own effort. ****
=

** **

There are many scholars and pundits who boast and want to prove tha=
t the
philosophy that they follow is superior to that of others'. These
phi=
losophies are like the materials used to keep the boy floating in water.
Wh=
ile one person uses an inflatable tube to keep afloat, others have used
the=
 dried, unpunctured bottle gourd, some use thermacool blocks, some
others u=
se float boards. What is important is that the student needs to
learn how t=
o swim; how to keep afloat - it does not matter what the aids
used are. No =
one will ever ask us what type of material we had used to keep
ourselves af=
loat while we were learning to swim. It is the same with
philosophies also;=
 the main criterion is to reach the goal. ****

** **

Truth is one but the=
 means to know it are numerous. Hence the facts
regarding the Truth are man=
y. Facts are not self-explanatory; they are
analysed by theories and theses=
 and these may differ from each other. We
have accumulated vast mounds of i=
nformation about the Truth, but very few
have experienced the Truth. ****

=
** **

Truth which is absolute can never be comprehended by the human mind =
since
it is relative. It is impossible to know the Absolute Truth although =
by the
uninterrupted sadhana and grace of the guru, the Self can experience=
 it.
Truth thus experienced is but our own experience. This is a universal =
law,
which, if understood, can take us to Bliss, eternal happiness. We are =
that
Self which is comprehensive, composite, part of Cosmic Consciousness a=
nd
therefore immortal and infinite -- beyond death and destruction. Awarene=
ss
of this is the experience of Truth. ****
