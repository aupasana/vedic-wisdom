Namaste

Just my two cents: There is a person who performs daily a Chandi h=
omam in a
foreign land where flowers are scarce. The person says that at th=
e end of
the homam, the water from the kalasha (pot) usually has some rose =
flavor
even though no rose flowers have been used anywhere in the homam.

W=
hether dhenu mudra has been used here or not, I do not know and do not
want=
 to verify. Experience is the best way. Relax and enjoy the experience
in t=
he moment you live.

best regards
Haro
