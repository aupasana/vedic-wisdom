Namaste to all,

Can somebody tell me another good book to read for Mahagan=
pati.
Actually everywhere i hear only about Aghora books.
I agree they are =
awesome but for when we are doing sadhna for any deity other than Maa Samsh=
an Tara or Chandi then, after reading aghora trilogy a misunderstanding com=
es to my mind that only those two are real or the most powerful.

So can so=
me one please guide me to some other book which gives explanation on "Mahag=
anpati" aspect of GOD.

Regards
Jitender
