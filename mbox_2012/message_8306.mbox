Subject: Re: Is this simple homam procedure satisfactory? For Narasimhaji

Just to say, I performed the homam I described above just now, and found th=
e entire process actually took 40 minutes. Five minutes were spent doing th=
e worship of Ganesh, Agni, Divine Mother and Guru. Ten minutes were spent s=
aying the mantras of Lakshmi and Narayana while offering ghee. As the fire =
lasted about 25 minutes after I finished making ghee offerings, I just watc=
hed the fire and did japa of Om Namo Narayanaya for this period. I guess I =
will insert the havan at the start of my japa practice instead of at the en=
d (as previously planned), as it takes a while for the fire to burn itself =
out and I could just say the mantra while this is happening. I enjoyed the =
experience overall, looking forward to doing more homams. 

Aparna
