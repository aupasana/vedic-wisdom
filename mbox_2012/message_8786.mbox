=C2=A0 
Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
First a word on "Pr=
asna". There are just 9 planets and 12 houses representing millions of thin=
gs. For example, Ketu shows mistakes and the same Ketu shows spiritual prog=
ress and even moksha. The 12th house shows losses and the same 12th house s=
hows moksha. When an astrologer looks at omens or planets influencing vario=
us houses, he/she obviously uses his/her judgment and intuition to connect =
the dots. His/her subjective opinions will of course come into play.
=C2=A0=

Even if a really good astrologer comes to know of the general area, he/she=
 need not be correct on all specifics. Please realize that he/she does not =
have a TV in which everything is "shown". Excellent astrologers and even ex=
cellent priests are not beyond biases and their own conditioning.
=C2=A0
If=
 I get a sense that you are making some
 mistake, I may talk about some tec=
hnicalities like counts, materials etc if that is what I am conditioned to =
focus on. I may talk about pronunciation if that is what I am conditioned t=
o focus on. I may talk about devotion if that is what I am conditioned to f=
ocus on.

=C2=A0
The tussle between the "letter" & "=
spirit" of scriptures will go on perennially. Those who stick to the "lette=
r" may find irreconcilable contradictions between different religions, trad=
itions and scriptures and may end up accepting one thing vs the other. Thos=
e who understand the "spirit" can often reconcile everything.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
Mixing a bit of ghee with every offering (and not just s=
esame seeds) is auspicious. But, if it is cumbersome, there is nothing wron=
g in
 offering materials individually, as long as SOME ghee is ALSO offered=
 in the homam separately. Of course, shastras actually talk about doing a h=
omam in complete absence of ghee also.
=C2=A0
Shastras are very flexible. S=
hastras say ghee made of cow's milk is the best. Otherwise, ghee made of bu=
ffalo's milk is preferred. If not, ghee made of goat's milk is preferred. I=
f not, sesame oil is preferred. A long list is given. In the worst case, ev=
en mustard oil (which is not a saattwik substance) is mentioned!
=C2=A0
The=
 bottomline is that making even inferior offerings is better than making no=
 offerings.
=C2=A0
As for sesame seeds, they are not "dry" like some other =
materials (wood, grains etc) and they contain plenty of sesame oil within t=
hem. Many scriptures actually praise sesame seeds.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=
=C2=A0
In any case, my friends, the physical
 materials you offer are *exte=
rnal symbols* or proxies and the real offering is made through mind.
=C2=A0=

Suppose you give an exquisite gift to a friend, but with disinterest and w=
rong attitude. Your friend may not like it. Suppose you give a humble gift,=
 but with a lot of love and caring. Your friend may appreciate it. Gods wil=
l appreciate your love, devotion, sincerity and surrender more than tons of=
 ghee, sesame seeds etc.
=C2=A0
As that surrender is weak within us, we are=
 taking help from external fire and making use of it to resonate with inner=
 fire and develop inner surrender. So we need to make reasonable external o=
fferings to the external fire to keep it going and keep it *saattwik*. So I=
 will not say that you can throw anything. But, as long as you offer basica=
lly saattwik materials and keep the fire going, you are all set. Instead of=
 getting too carried away with rules and technicalities, focus on your ment=
al condition and
 feeling.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Once I attended a =
homam conducted by a gentleman who is now the head of a nice temple-cum-ash=
ram. He announced before poornahuti "this poornahuti contains 64 auspicious=
 and rare materials specially procured from India. You are so lucky to witn=
ess this poornahuti. You may not get such an opportunity again". THIS attit=
ude of pride or feeling special is a "dosha" if you ask me. Poornahuti is s=
upposed to be "complete surrender" to deity and not an occasion to feel pro=
ud of what materials you are offering. If someone else offers just one copr=
a or even a raisin (kismis or dried grape) and really feels the sense of su=
rrender to the deity and meditates with focus, it may be a *far superior* p=
oornaahuti.
=C2=A0
External also matters when our minds are so deeply tied =
to it. But don't get overly caught in the external. Make the right
 tradeof=
fs - do just enough at the external level and focus most energy on the inte=
rnal side. That is MY humble advice.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The 10-to=
-1 ratio rule is not universally followed by all.
=C2=A0
If one has enough =
time to meditate with a mantra for 10 hours for every 1 hour of homam with =
it, fine, go ahead and do it.
=C2=A0
In the old days, people spent hours on=
 spiritual sadhana everyday and were quite pure. Times have changed. If one=
 has only 30-60 minutes everyday for spiritual sadhana, spending that time =
in front of fire is the optimum way to use it.
=C2=A0
If one wants to paint=
 a perfect picture on a special canvas to submit for an important event, on=
e may want to first practice on normal paper and paint it on the special ca=
nvas after becoming proficient. If one does not have that much time, it may=
 be better to just draw an
 imperfect picture on the special canvas and sub=
mit it. Similarly, getting some practice with a mantra before offering it i=
n the all-powerful Fire is a good idea. But, if one has limited time, one h=
as to make wise tradeoffs.
=C2=A0
One factor is that Fire amplifies results=
. If someone who is basically quite pure makes offerings in Fire with a man=
tra that he used in past lives, progress may come too quickly and it may be=
 unnerving. With japam, things may happen slower.
=C2=A0
But that is unlike=
ly to happen to most people today anyway. Even if it does, it is debatable =
whether it is bad or good. My guess is that the 0.0001% to whom such a thin=
g happens will figure out how to deal with it.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=
=A0
As I always say, I am not a missionary. How many people do homam and wh=
at rules they follow, do not concern me. I am just an enabler. I merely
 ma=
ke some resources available. People are free to take it or leave it. Also, =
people are free to follow any rules set by their gurus or elders or just th=
eir inner voice. They need not pay heed to my 2 cents.
=C2=A0
In the end, e=
very soul has its path to traverse.

Happy Vijaya Dasami friends!
