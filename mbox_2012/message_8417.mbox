Namaste Narasimha Guru,

> Nice and blunt message that can truly inspire so=
me sadhakas who are 
> confused!

I beg to differ here albeit only a little=
. The message can actually inspire almost everybody who are some or the oth=
er way in to spiritual Sadhana including the people who are truly confused.=


It is inspiring for the people who are getting pulled in too many directi=
on of life due to various sense weaknesses as well as various responsibilit=
ies,but who still rue the fact that they waste away their time and instead =
should invest that for God. It is also inspiring & eye opener for the peopl=
e who talk big philosopohies and love of God and what may have you but shy =
away from even a little bit of sadhana. It is a spiritual Tamacha which is =
required occassionaly to all of us or most of us in varying degree includin=
g the writer of the message.It is also for the people who are really deep i=
n to Sadhana and still want to be better at that. I am of the opinion that =
this message, in future, will truly inspire some fortunate few and change t=
he course of their lives. As is everybody's experience in life that sometim=
e Slap works much faster and better. Bitter medicines cures faster, Harsh t=
ruth needs to be spoken sometimes for good and there are so many examples w=
here it is recorded that many a times, Spiritual Gurus have push very bitte=
r pills for their disciples.     
I sincerely hope that readers do not get =
depress or angry/furious or even confuse due to the bluntness of the messag=
e. I hope also that Ahmkaara does not get hurt. As the basic and important =
Wisdom goes - not get lost in words but to understand the soul of message -=
 and that will happen is my wish. It must bang the door of one's heart so t=
hat little by little people start cutting down on many unnecessary entertai=
nment and use more time for God or whatever term one like to use. This lect=
ure includes Me in the first palce. Shuruat merese Ho!

This is not at all =
a "Vyakti Puja" or something like that....but it is "Message Puja" surely!
=
That message was like "cleansing spirit" on the wound and your response was=
 like a "soothing Malam" and i wrote for shhhhfuuu..shhhhfuuu

Finsihing th=
is, I wish you and everybody, a very happy Gupt Navaratri!

Yours Lovingly,=


Utpal
