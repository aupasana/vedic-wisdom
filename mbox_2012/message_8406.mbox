c-wisdom] Re: How to repeat God's Name constantly?




Thanks to everyone w=
ho has replied- I know you're right. Feeling and heart is more important th=
an counting and numbers.

But how does feeling come? Though japa! That is t=
he paradox. Sivananda says, even if it is mechanical sometimes, keep doing =
it. The mind will be purified and one day, feeling will come, devotion will=
 arise.

Some of my favourite quotations on the power of japa:

Swami Sivan=
anda
"Religion Means 'To Do.' It is only the one two little acts that you a=
ctually do, that constitute religion and spirituality. To rise early and ta=
ke the name of the Lord for ten minutes is what real dharma is."
More from =
him on japa 

http://www.sivanandadlshq.org/teachings/japayoga.htm

Swami C=
hidananda (ace disciple of Swami Sivananda)
"One's day should start first w=
ith purifying, with cleaning, sweeping, making clean! Cleanse, cleanse - by=
 uttering God's Name, by thinking of God. The Name of God is verily God Him=
self. Supreme Divinity is present here. Name and God are not two. They are =
one and the same. Name is God!"

Anandamayi Ma
"Listen! Do not let your tim=
e pass idly. Either keep a rosary with you and do japa; or if this does not=
 suit you, at least go on repeating the Name of the Lord regularly and with=
out interruption like the ticking of a clock. There are no rules or restric=
tions in this. Invoke Him by the Name that appeals to you most, for as much=
 time as you can--the longer the better. Even if you get tired or lose inte=
rest, administer the Name to yourself like a medicine that has to be taken.=
 In this way you will at some auspicious moment discover the rosary of the =
mind, and then you will continually hear within yourself the praises of the=
 great Master, the Lord of Creation, like the never ceasing music of the bo=
undless ocean; You will hear the land and the sea, the air and the heavens =
reverberate with the song of His glory. This is called the all--pervading P=
resence of His Name."

Priyank, thanks very much for the message. Warren Bu=
ffet...cool! I will try and do homam more often- I really enjoy it. Will sc=
hedule one for tomorrow evening after work if possible. Good start to the N=
avaratri (had never heard about this Navaratri before). 

Rakesh ji, thanks=
 for the message. You are quite right. Even breathing for God...that would =
be a great state to be in...no idea when I'm going to get there. Anyway pes=
erverence is key. 

I think that nobody but God can get us to do Sadhana. I=
 believe that God walked every step of the way on the path for the saints..=
. nay, actually DID the sadhana for them ultimately. I know we have to "mak=
e an effort" and meet God halfway, but ultimately it is She and He who get =
us to make the effort. That's why I said "Damn you Durga"....because You ma=
de some people make that supreme effort....You alone were their Sadhana Sha=
kti....and what about the rest of Your wretched children? What sort of part=
ial mother are you hmm? You did it for Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, but what a=
bout all of us eh? What sort of game is this? Anyway, it's Her game, that's=
 the bottom line... what can we do except play along (we have to believe it=
's ultimately for our own good).

Ok chaps, going to do some japa now. Less=
 talk and more action hey!

Best wishes, and happy Navaratri (let's get in =
to high gear as Priyank ji says),

Aparna
