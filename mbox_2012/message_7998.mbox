Hemanth Ji

There was no Brahma Hatya.Dadichi was brought back to life by t=
he Ashwini Kumaras and Sage Dadichi imparted Brahma vidya and also the tech=
nique to bring him back to life before the operation was done.

However com=
ing to the main point of Organ donation,Dadichi's story itself is a great p=
roof for doing it .Sage Dadichi remarks very specificly in the story that i=
t is a great honour for him that the mortal body which will decay into the =
earth is actually being used for a great purpose !!!!.

Also the story abov=
e will have many hidden layers of meanings which only a mystic might be abl=
e to decode. 

Even leaving all of that aside .Vimalananda is held in high =
regard by this group and at many places in his books ,he has held living a =
straight life and helping fellow beings higher than anything else.

I see t=
he logic behind following Abhisheka, homa and using all of the tools (Mantr=
a/Tantra) .But to advocate against organ donation after the body has perish=
ed and will ultimately decompose into the earth ...whereas it could end up =
giving life to somebody else would not be correct.

Also the future travel =
of the soul after death is not solely dependent on the 16 sanskaras or shan=
ti karma or tarpana. It depends hugely on the sadhana that particular perso=
n had performed during his lifetime and how well that particular person had=
 prepared for his death. Why would donating the organs and cremating rest o=
f the body change the trajectory of the soul.

If that were true every body=
 given a proper cremation with shanti karmas should have reincarnated as si=
ddha purushas by this time .
