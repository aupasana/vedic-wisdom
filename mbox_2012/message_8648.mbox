Namaste Utpalji,
Thank you so much for sharing your personal experiences as=
 these will surely give insight of what others have gone through. Frankly i=
 had very trying situations & those difficulties made me turn to spiritual =
path.

      Namaste Vinayak,



[you are the one of t=
he 4

> prominent people who have influenced & inspired me on spiritual pat=
h]



I am sure the 2nd important person is me :)

Jokes apart, let me shar=
e a little bit of my personal background on Sudrashan Kriya and Homa as i h=
ave done both practices.



I learnt SK in 2005 and then almost daily kept =
doing it till 2008 mid. I also learnt advance course as well as Padmasadhan=
a (PS) from AOL in 2006. I also regularly kept doing PS ALMOST everyday. Fo=
r about 3 years, I used to do SK and PS regularly. 



Now I got started wi=
th Homa on daily basis since 2008 Sept and keep doing it till date (with fe=
w breaks/irregularities at times) and since then I have stopped SK, however=
 sometime do PS as i enjoy that systematic Yogaasanas.



Just gave above b=
ackground which may help to assess.

***

SK and PS helped me cure some phy=
sical chronic issues which troubled me since childhood and were helpful to =
strengthen my will power. It generated an inner attitude to sustain any pro=
blems or calamities life may throw by making my mind generally calmer then =
it used to be. I am able to say that because I actually faced deep crises i=
n 2006 July to sept and I was still more or less unperturbed and could hand=
le the situation. i increasingly become philosophical in my attitude.



No=
w I started Chandi paath and Havan combination in 2008. if i now sit back a=
nd look at things then i can see some striking differences. Havan and CP co=
mbination striked at my emotional aspect. In the past, i was hardly tested =
on Emotional/Relational issues in general with society. i hardly faced any =
trouble in that area. However, when I started Havan and CP, it looks that i=
t badly attacked this aspect of my being and I was severely tested. in Shor=
t, My public relations which used to be always excellent (naturally) starte=
d falling apart. It shook me up very badly as it never happened in the past=
 and I did not have enough experience, knowledge to handle such things. sev=
ere EQ testing then surfaced other weaknesses which i felt that i never had=
 :-). it amazed me at one side while at the same time It threw a formidable=
 challenge to my so called **ballooned spiritual ego**. All these happening=
 were more inside and much less tangible outside. There are crises
 i went =
through in my job which also tested me a lot. I lost a good some of money i=
n a cheating case within 6 months of starting Havan. however, fortunately I=
 intuitionally realised that Mother is removing bad karmas using Pavaka and=
 I steadfastly kept doing Havan in the midst of all these emotional, financ=
ial, career, family troubles and now it seems as if the dust have been sett=
led more or less. quite peaceful with myself after seeing Stars in the brig=
ht Sunny day ;-)



***

So if now i compare it, the peace of mind and will=
 power given by SK and PS was a surface one. They never created a situation=
 where in i was ruthlessly tested on my weaknesses. So i would say that the=
y are spiritual practices which worked quite slowly and quite easily withou=
t disturbing me. While CP and Homam actually turned me on my head. It start=
ed giving me a real kind of Detachment, wisdom. Few vital things have becom=
e much clearer now.

***

Please note that these are my personal experience=
s and others can have entirely different experiences. there are many variab=
les in this. i just tried to state my own experiences for whatever worth th=
ey may be. Please also note that Havan Sadhana does not necessarily throw t=
hroubles in life of people. It all depends upon Past Samskaars of individua=
ls. we'll not know such things.

***

Please forgive me to almost always wr=
ite personal things because I like to write the things which i have gone th=
rough myself.



Jay Bhavaani!
