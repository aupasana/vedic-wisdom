Dear Rajarshiji,

The story is interesting......but forgive me, incomplete!=
 From a learning point of view, I would like to know what Mr Iyer and the s=
adhu in the temple advise to reach God. I accept that the finite can never =
grasp the infinite- what should we do then, how shall we reach God, the inf=
inite- Who we are given to understand is the Goal of all, a Being or State =
in which all misery ends?

It is fine to declare religions as an obstacle, =
but if that is the case, what is the solution? None of us wishes to waste o=
ur lifetime in futile spiritual pursuits. Please tell us what spiritual pat=
h the character in this tale learnt and if it helped him. Perhaps it would =
be useful for us to know about this too.

Many thanks,

Aparna

man turned around and spoke to X in clear English, "Hello, I was waiting fo=

the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the rea=
son for all the religious troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little irr=

If you have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven't met a single g=
enuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take=
 Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confu=

meet that man, he is not accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The =

 man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the h=
uman brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man o=

egarded by others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I sa=
y the root of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finit=

, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one =
pull finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5=
 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, "You=

 3 decades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact with t=

he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one m=

 this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and the g=
irl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards the cot w=
here Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the opp =
direction to the cot. He too turned round to see what was going on. What he=
 saw made his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged begg=
ar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his=
 early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brillian=

, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked no=
t a human being any more but a god sitting in place of what was even five m=
inutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.

> X did not know =
what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stand up a=

ot and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When he wok=
e up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location with trees and shru=
bs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him inside=
 the temple precincts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it an old =
man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar di=

t of the temple. That is the man I was talking about, he said. You should m=
