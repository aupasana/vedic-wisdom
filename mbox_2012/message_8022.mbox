Dear Narasimha Ji

Namaste.

I have read the Homa manual for Sani Deva and =
watched the video of Maha Ganapati Homa (to understand practically) and hav=
e a few questions. I fear some questions might be silly, you could answer s=
hortly or just with yes/no when it is appropriate.

1. Can I perform a homa=
m in a bedroom floor? Or would be be disrespectful since husband and wives =
sleep in that room?

2. One drop of seasame oil / some other oil and one pi=
nch of turmeric powder / vermillion powder are to be mixed with uncooked ri=
ce to make Akshata. What if the quantity of uncooked rice is a little much,=
 then should I use *a few drops* of oil and *a few pinches of vermillion* w=
ith it to keep a well proportion and keep it sticky? Or is the condition st=
rictly *one drop* and *one pinch* no matter now much the amount of rice is?=


3. Were you doing a Gyana-Mudra while performing achamanam in the Maha Ga=
napati Homam video?

4. You have listed camphor in the optional list of mat=
erials. So if camphor is not available, what is the recommended procedure t=
o light the fire in homa-kunda?

5. On the east of the homa kunda, we keep =
a plate, and some uncooked rice on it to make a small pile and Lord Sani's =
idol or the coin over the rice. But since the idol/coin is optional, I can =
skip keeping it and I guess then there is no need for keeping the plate and=
 rice also. (Since the rice is to keep the idol on it, I guess?] Am I corre=
ct?

6. After giving fire to homa kunda

(A) there is a mantra requesting a=
gni to take the auspicious form [jataveda] and to convey the offerings to t=
he Gods.

then

(B) there is a small mantra which we repeat 8 times and mak=
e offerings to make the fire pure.

In the short version you have instructe=
d to do (A) in one's mother tongue and skipped (B). But since the mantra of=
 (B) is very short and easy to remember, can I still do it with the mantra =
while doing (A) simply with my mother tongue?

7. While you have taken aksh=
ata in left hand, the palm seemed to have kept facing upwards and then when=
 the akshata in right hand, the palm was kept downwards. Is there any rules=
 like so? Or can I keep it any way I want?

8. What to do with the akshata =
(that I used in pranayama) after finishing the homa? Also, what to do with =
the unused akshata (remaining in the main pot) after I finish the homa?

9.=
 I think the Sanskrit word for 'offering' is 'Ahuti'. Would you please tell=
 me the Sanskrit word for 'invoke' (such as, in the fire)?

10. In the main=
 homam, we say 'vaushat' instead of 'svaha' in the last repetition of the m=
antra when we are going to start another mantra. What if I do the main homa=
m with one mantra only (and then move to naivedyam)... Do I still say 'vaus=
hat' instead of 'svaha' on the last time of repetition?

11. I understand t=
hat the cooked rice or fruit used in Shuddhanna Bali should not be consumed=
. Here did you mean *ONLY THOSE six chunks* of cooked rice / the *six piece=
s* of fruits *PLACED IN THE SIX PLACES* should not be eaten? Or does it ALS=
O INCLUDE the remaining fruits in the main store of fruits with me from whe=
re I was taking fruits to offer in fire also?

To illustrate, please let me=
 assume that I took total 300 grams of apple while I started the homam.

A.=
 100 grams apple I have offered in the fire, so burnt.

B. 60 grams apple I=
 have offered to Naivedyam, and after offering a bit from it in the fire, I=
 kept it separately as blessed foods. I can consume it and share it with ot=
hers.

C. 40 grams of apples were those six pieces those I placed in the si=
x places for shuddhanna bali. I can't eat them. I will throw them away to t=
he bin after the homam.

D. 20 grams of apples offered in purnahuti, burnt.=


E. 80 grams of apple is still on the bowl that remains fully unused (from=
 the initial 300 grams) after the homa completes.

Since you wrote in the m=
anual "Any fruit pieces left over after bali should be thrown away" so does=
 this "non-eatable fruits" mean ONLY the fruits in "C" or does it mean the =
fruits it C+E also?

In case it meant only "C", what is recommended for the=
 fruits of "E"? or should all the fruits of D+E is to be actually given to =
purnahuti, that I can't leave any of the fruits unused that I sat with?

12=
. In the video you have said the mantra of purnahuti while holding the half=
-copra with hand on your head. But in the manual its written to put it on t=
he ladle while saying the mantra. So can I just do it with the hand as you =
did in the video?

13.

(A) What do I do with the ghee that is left unused =
after the homam finishes? Can I simply put it back in the fridge to use it =
for later homams?

(B) What to do with the water in the pot after the homam=
 finishes? 

(C) Since the ash at the kunda is sacred, what to do with it? =
I mean, if i simply throw it off somewhere while cleaning, won't it be disr=
espectful?

Anyone sharing their knowledge will be also appreciated.

Thank=
s,
Tanvir
