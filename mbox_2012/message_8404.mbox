Thanks to everyone who has replied- I know you're right. Feeling and hea=
rt is more important than counting and numbers.

But how does feeling come?=
 Though japa! That is the paradox. Sivananda says, even if it is mechanical=
 sometimes, keep doing it. The mind will be purified and one day, feeling w=
ill come, devotion will arise.

Some of my favourite quotations on the powe=
r of japa:

Swami Sivananda
"Religion Means 'To Do.' It is only the one two=
 little acts that you actually do, that constitute religion and spiritualit=
y. To rise early and take the name of the Lord for ten minutes is what real=
 dharma is."
More from him on japa 

http://www.sivanandadlshq.org/teaching=
s/japayoga.htm

Swami Chidananda (ace disciple of Swami Sivananda)
"One's d=
ay should start first with purifying, with cleaning, sweeping, making clean=
! Cleanse, cleanse - by uttering God's Name, by thinking of God. The Name o=
f God is verily God Himself. Supreme Divinity is present here. Name and God=
 are not two. They are one and the same. Name is God!"

Anandamayi Ma
"List=
en! Do not let your time pass idly. Either keep a rosary with you and do ja=
pa; or if this does not suit you, at least go on repeating the Name of the =
Lord regularly and without interruption like the ticking of a clock. There =
are no rules or restrictions in this. Invoke Him by the Name that appeals t=
o you most, for as much time as you can--the longer the better. Even if you=
 get tired or lose interest, administer the Name to yourself like a medicin=
e that has to be taken. In this way you will at some auspicious moment disc=
over the rosary of the mind, and then you will continually hear within your=
self the praises of the great Master, the Lord of Creation, like the never =
ceasing music of the boundless ocean; You will hear the land and the sea, t=
he air and the heavens reverberate with the song of His glory. This is call=
ed the all--pervading Presence of His Name."

Priyank, thanks very much for=
 the message. Warren Buffet...cool! I will try and do homam more often- I r=
eally enjoy it. Will schedule one for tomorrow evening after work if possib=
le. Good start to the Navaratri (had never heard about this Navaratri befor=
e). 

Rakesh ji, thanks for the message. You are quite right. Even breathin=
g for God...that would be a great state to be in...no idea when I'm going t=
o get there. Anyway peserverence is key. 

I think that nobody but God can =
get us to do Sadhana. I believe that God walked every step of the way on th=
e path for the saints... nay, actually DID the sadhana for them ultimately.=
 I know we have to "make an effort" and meet God halfway, but ultimately it=
 is She and He who get us to make the effort. That's why I said "Damn you D=
urga"....because You made some people make that supreme effort....You alone=
 were their Sadhana Shakti....and what about the rest of Your wretched chil=
dren? What sort of partial mother are you hmm? You did it for Mira, Rabia, =
Papa Ramdas, but what about all of us eh? What sort of game is this? Anyway=
, it's Her game, that's the bottom line... what can we do except play along=
 (we have to believe it's ultimately for our own good).

Ok chaps, going to=
 do some japa now. Less talk and more action hey!

Best wishes, and happy N=
avaratri (let's get in to high gear as Priyank ji says),

Aparna

obsessed with the Name. I firmly believe in it. I got sick (real sick) a fe=

 long story, but basically, I was conscious during these black outs, and it=
 felt like I was dying...and it sounds odd, but there were no thoughts exce=
pt the Name "Keshava please help me" or "Narayana"). These episodes scared =

I'm in deep sh*t (pardon my language), the Name alone is reliable.

 big fan of japa, and especially of Purascharana (repeating mantra as many =
lakhs as there are syllables in the mantra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so=
 one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetitions). He went on to say that 14 crore =
of japa with feeling would result in Darshan of God in physical form, face =
to face. That would be great! Really wanted to do it...but when I did the m=
aths, I worked out that, at the rate of 12 hours japa a day, every single d=
ay from now on, it would take me till age 83 to finish this. :( 
> >

ut hey, I decided to make a start anyway, and began my my first Purascharan=
a of the Om Namo Narayanaya mantra, in January this year, I am doing a meas=
ley 11 rounds a day, with my mind wandering most of the time (hard core peo=
ple do hundreds of rounds with proper concentration daily). I'm a slow chan=
ter, and need to say the mantra loudly or in a barely audible whisper. My m=
ental chanting is gradually improving but very difficult to do for more tha=
n 1-2 minutes. It's gonna take me till October 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. =
Then my plan is to take a 3 month break (and do 7 rounds a day), and then s=

elephone Japa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pretend I'm on the phone. Wh=

> >

he other thing that I find useful (now please excuse the phrase), is "Toile=

very very quietly mutter the mantra to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips moving=
, no sound audible, in case anybody hears). I do about 2 sessions of this a=
 day. This allows me to complete my 11 rounds a day, on days when my workin=
