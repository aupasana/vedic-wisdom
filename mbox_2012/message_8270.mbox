Jal=C4=81l ad-D=C4=ABn Mu=E1=B8=A5ammad R=C5=ABm=C4=AB was a 13th-century
P=
ersian Muslim poet, jurist, theologian, and Sufi mystic. R=C5=ABm=C4=AB
is =
a descriptive name meaning "Roman" since he lived most of his life in
an ar=
ea called "R=FBm". Rumi's father was Bah=C4=81 ud-D=C4=ABn Walad, a
theolog=
ian, jurist and a mystic from Wakhsh. When the Mongols invaded
Central Asia=
 sometime between 1215 and 1220, Baha ud-Din Walad, with his
whole family a=
nd a group of disciples, set out westwards. According to
hagiographical acc=
ount  Rumi encountered one of the most famous mystic
Persian poets, 'Attar,=
 in the Iranian city of Nishapur, located in the
province of Khor=C4=81s=C4=
=81n. 'Attar immediately recognized Rumi's
spiritual eminence. He saw the f=
ather walking ahead of the son and said,
"Here comes a sea followed by an o=
cean." He gave the boy his
Asr=C4=81rn=C4=81ma, a book about the entangleme=
nt of the soul in the
material world. This meeting had a deep impact on the=
 eighteen-year-old
Rumi and later on became the inspiration for his works. =
He then spend a
large part of his life as a Maulavi and a teacher of Islami=
c
Jurisprudence.

It was his meeting with the dervish Shams-e Tabrizi on 15=
 November 1244
that completely changed his life. From an accomplished teach=
er and
jurist, Rumi was transformed into an ascetic. Shams had traveled
thr=
oughout the Middle East searching and praying for someone who could
"endure=
 my company". A voice said to him, "What will you give in
return?" Shams re=
plied, "My head!" The voice then said, "The one you
seek is Jalal ud-Din of=
 Konya." So Shams went to the school where Rumi
was a teacher. He found Rum=
i discoursing on Scepticism and Neoplatonism,
and stringing many a brillian=
t pearl of metaphysics.  Heaps of books lay
around and in front of him, and=
 on his lips was the key to all their
mysteries.

Looking at all this intel=
lectual scholarship of Rumi, Shams i Tabriz
cried out, "What is all this no=
ise and babble? What are all these
syllogisms and judgments and demonstrati=
ons?"
"Peace, O fool!" Exclaimed the Maulvi (Rumi), "Do not laugh
at the do=
ctrines of the sages. Get out of my college! This is argument
and discussio=
n; what have you to do with it? My discourse is beyond your
understanding. =
It brightens the glass of perception!"

Shams did not say a word but starte=
d walking away, when to the surprise
of all present, the whole library of b=
ooks caught fire and turned to
ashes. Rumi cried in dismay, "How did you ki=
ndle this fire, which
has burned the books of the philosophers?" Shams repl=
ied, "O
unbeliever, this is vision and ecstasy: what have you to do with it=
? My
state is beyond your thought, my flame is the Alchemist's elixir."
Rum=
i left his school and scholarship and started following Shams from
then on.=


On the night of 5 December 1248, as Rumi and Shams were talking, Shams
wa=
s called to the back door. He went out, never to be seen again. It is
rumor=
ed that Shams was murdered by other Muslim clerics with the
connivance of R=
umi's son; if so, Shams indeed gave his head for the
privilege of their mys=
tical friendship.

Rumi's love for, and his bereavement at the death of, Sh=
ams found their
expression in an outpouring lyric poems, Divan-e Shams-e Ta=
brizi. He
himself went out searching for Shams and journeyed again to Damas=
cus.
There, he realized:

     Why should I seek? I am the same as
     He.=
 His essence speaks through me.
     I have been looking for myself!

A few=
 translated couplets from Rumi's most famous work, Masnavi:

"How could you=
 reach the pearl by only looking at the sea? If you seek
the pearl, be a di=
ver."

"Observe the wonders as they occur around you. Don't claim them. Fee=
l
the artistry moving through & be silent."

"I started looking for you, no=
t knowing how blind that was. Lovers
don't finally meet somewhere. They are=
 in each other all along."

"Yesterday i was clever, so i wanted to change =
the world; today i am
wise so i am changing myself."

"There is no Love gre=
ater than Love with no object. For then you,
yourself, have become love, it=
self..."

"If you are too careful, love will not find you."

"Everything in=
 the universe is a pitcher brimming with wisdom and
beauty."

"If in thirst=
 you drink water from a cup, you see God in it. Those who
are not in love w=
ith God will see only their own faces in it."

"Reason is the shadow cast b=
y God; God is the sun."

"Do not feel lonely, the entire universe is inside=
 of you."

"Love said to me, there is nothing that is not me. Be silent."

=
"The rose's rarest essence lives in the thorns."

"Why do you stay in priso=
n when the door is so wide open? Move outside
the tangle of fear-thinking. =
Live in silence."

"Deafened by the voice of desire you are unaware the Bel=
oved lives in
the core of your heart. Stop the noise and you will hear His =
voice in
the silence"

"Who could be so lucky? Who comes to a lake for wate=
r and sees the
reflection of moon."

"I don't know much; I have lost all my=
 knowledge because I'm just
intoxicated with a glass of Love."

"When you c=
ome looking for sugar, your bag will be examined to see how
much it can hol=
d; it will be filled accordingly."

"God turns you from one feeling to anot=
her & teaches you by means of
opposites, so that you will have two wings to=
 fly - not one."

"The closer I get, the more I see how far I am."

"By God=
 when you see your beauty you will be the idol for yourself."

"You are the=
 secret of God's secret"

"We search for Him here & there, while looking ri=
ght at Him. Sitting by
His side, we ask; 'O Beloved, where is the Beloved?"=


"When I look in my innermost self, I see that the Universe has not yet
be=
en created"

"What is the soul? Consciousness. The more awareness, the deep=
er the
soul, and when such essence overflows, you feel sacredness around."
=

"Death has nothing to do with going away. The sun sets and the moon
sets, =
but they're not gone."

"When we are dead, seek not our tomb in the earth, =
but find it in the
hearts of men"

"Love is the astrolabe of God's mysterie=
s"

"When your heart is immersed in this blissful love, you can easily
endu=
re any bitter face around."

"O traveler, if you are in search of That; Don=
't look outside, look
inside yourself and seek That"

"Come, come, whoever =
you are, Wanderer, idolater, worshiper of fire,
Come even though you have b=
roken your vows a thousand times, Come, and
come yet again. Ours is not a c=
aravan of despair."
