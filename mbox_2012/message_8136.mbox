Dear Rchalla,
=C2=A0
Excellent suggestion and insight by Prantik=C2=A0and v=
ery true, This happens very much in the sadhana and the goal is to cross al=
l this , This is just a test to stengthen the mind and also a divine play t=
o take you closer, because the Mother loves you 
=C2=A0
As I understand we =
need to cross all this and one day we need to drop this very mind, Crossing=
 this helps to strengthen the Atma Shakthi which is very much required duri=
ng our transition from the body or for the enligtenment experience.
=C2=A0
=
As Prantik said, it is very very important to keep the brahmacharya as the =
life force should not be depleted which would help to overcome this tempora=
ry situation and aids well for the surrender to happen
=C2=A0
Also one more=
 suggestion is to offer everything to the Divine Mothers feet, the thoughts=
, emotions, negativity...=C2=A0everything is hers only the lower self=C2=A0=
 thinks otherwise
=C2=A0
One more thing is just be a witness to whatever th=
oughts=C2=A0comes and=C2=A0chant the Devi Kavacham, as suggested by the oth=
er friends here , It is extremely potent.
=C2=A0
Please remember you are no=
 sinner and are=C2=A0a spirtual being ..These are not my words and feel I a=
m just used as a medium thorough my Guru and the Cosmic mother.
=C2=A0
Take=
 care and have a blessed day
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

=C2=A0 
no in my opinion you=
 don't have any psychic problems nor are you i suppose a "ghora papi"...it =
is only a stage one experiences while on the path of sadhana and is quite n=
atural...what you are saying is actually not much strange at all
many peopl=
e experience such type of negativity or oddities either in the starting sta=
ge or in the middle stage of aquiring concentration
what you need is a disc=
iplined lifestyle and brahmacharya...which is very important
also do puja r=
egularly and as one of our friends have suggested yes recite a particular s=
totra with its meaning known...doing this regularly after taking bath...wil=
l slowly ward it off...dont pay much heed...and if this happens to you when=
 you keep your eyes closed then keep it open while reciting...
slowly you w=
ill develope concentration...
elders in this forum including narasimha ji m=
ay come up with better suggestions too...
hope this helps
