Dear All,
=A0
the=A0wonderful poem reminded me of the
famous lines of Nida =
Fazli:
=A0
"Sabki puja ek  si,  alag alag hai reet. 
Masjid jaye maulvi, ko=
el gaye geet"
=A0
every time i go to a temple i have to shoot
the plate kep=
t infront of the idol.
every plate has certain elements in it
and each of t=
hem have their own moods
and personalities.
=A0
i love to capture these moo=
ds and
the natural beauty and the surroundings of temples.
this esp happens=
 when we go to the hills- Himachal,
Uttaranchal etc.=A0
and, this really ir=
ritates my husband.
=A0
however, i just=A0quoted the above lines to him
onc=
e and he couldn't retaliate :)
=A0
to some praying to the man made idol is =
important
but if i jus lose myself into the beauty of His Creation
and find=
 Him in everyting isn't that a prayer too....
=A0
Wonderful poem sir!
=A0

hanks n rgds.
