Hi,

Thanks again to all for their responses.

Shankar ji, I am glad you ha=
ve found a useful yoga program. However I am very wary of awakening kundali=
ni deliberately myself. I have heard of people going crazy from doing it wi=
thout the proper devotion and surrender to the Divine. I am scared of the i=
dea of siddhis/kundalini etc etc....I don't trust myself to handle this sor=
t of thing at all. I don't have the wisdom to handle kundalini shakti/siddh=
is etc. 

I see siddhis as the evil Ring in the Lord of the Rings....a powe=
r than can really be misused. I know that siddhis are not inherently evil, =
but are actually Divine...but they can cause a great fall if acquired witho=
ut the prerequite devotion, as one can really fatten one's ego with them. T=
hey are a dangerous temptation in my view. 

I prefer to see myself as a si=
lly child of the Divine, doing Japa etc to the amusement of the Divine pare=
nts. What a silly child, they must be thinking. I like this idea. 

I prefe=
r to do Japa, and let God decide if She and He wants to awaken my kundalini=
. Durga Herself IS the kundalini, I dare not wake her up without her explic=
it permission (else all hell will probably break loose!) So I'm content wit=
h doing Japa for now (this contentment is thanks to Her), and with letting =
Her wake up in her own sweet time. :)

Gaurav ji, I don't yet have the devo=
tion to see God by saying the mantra just once. So gotta do it many many ma=
ny times (yep with maths involved)!

Srinivas ji, I can't do the mantra tha=
t quickly! I'm a slow chanter- it helps create a bit of feeling. Otherwise =
like Sivananda says, I feel like a contractor doing his job in a hurry. 

S=
aranyan ji, nice quote from Ramakrishna. I agree with your point...with har=
d work and sincerity (and some Grace), no doubt devotion will eventually ar=
ise. 

Rakesh ji, thank for the message...I will look up the story in the B=
hagavatam that you mention.

Hiramalini ji, cool story about the boy and Gu=
ru showing the importance of faith. Thanks.

Well, I'll keep up the mantra =
practice....sometimes with feeling, sometimes mechanically, and trust that =
all will work out for the best.

Best wishes,

Aparna

 me till October 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to take a 3 mo=
