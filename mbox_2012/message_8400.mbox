Dear Priyank,

About 3 years back, one Senior knowledgable and kind person =
sent me following message which probably would be helpful. I am posting the=
 excerpts below:

[
Blessed are those whose intentions are pure, and those =
who come to Mata, are blessed irrespective of anything. This is most import=
ant, even if someone is not able to win over all the shadripus and falters =
for a while, but repents later on and pleads to Mother for Her love, grace =
and blessings, he is blessed. Maa treats her devotees really like her child=
ren and pardons all follies. Not only this, Jagadamba blesses everyone to g=
et whatever they want, be it laukika or alaukika.
So blessed you stand.
Cha=
ndi Patha is always beneficial, but it is extremely potent to be done durin=
g navrattras. The Sharadiya and Vasantik Navarattra are common knowledge, b=
ut there are two gupt Navrattras, thereby making 4 per year, 3 months apart=
 each. Patha with sankalpa is certain to give tangible results.
One more se=
cret, if you are able to do it in a siddha temple of Mata, results are more=
 pronounced. If you visit any of the 51/52 SHAKTI-PEETHAs during navrattris=
 for darshan, Phala of 1 Chandi-patha is immediately condescended upon you =
as soon as you have darshan. A patha in Shakti-Peetha during Navratri gives=
 result of 108 pathas.
And these are not just exaggerated sayings or belief=
s, these are verified by Siddhas.
Best Wishes,
]

Best Regards,

Utpal
