I plan to do deepa homam due to apartment restrictions. 
=C2=A0
So I was wo=
ndering for the part of naivedyam and niranjanam samarpayami how do I offer=
=C2=A0naivedyam and camphor in deepam.=C2=A0=C2=A0
=C2=A0
When should I con=
sider my homam done. Should I wait for the=C2=A0wick and ghee to both get o=
ver or only ghee? 
=C2=A0
In deepa homam which part is the karmic residue?I=
s it ghee?=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I think the answer is no but still is it ok=C2=A0to=
 maintain that lamp by pouring oil continously in it without allowing to ex=
tinguish and kept=C2=A0near god so I can continue my homam=C2=A0again next =
day.

=C2=A0 
Namaste,

The size of t=
he fire matters. Doing homam with a small fire using 3-4 small dry coconut =
pieces is also definitely good and useful, but doing homam with a bigger fi=
re has a stronger effect on one's consciousness. With either practice, of c=
ourse, the key to success are regularity and persistence.

If someone has a=
n apartment in a western country without any fireplace or balcony and doing=
 homam with dry coconut pieces next to a window in a room is also not possi=
ble due to strict fire rules, I want to suggest an option that enables a mi=
ni-homam. Such people can do a "deepa homam" (homam in a lamp). Pour some m=
elted ghee in a small mud/copper/silver/bronze/brass/golden pot (or lamp st=
and). Put in a wick in it. Treating it as a homa kundam, do homam normally.=
 When it is time to install fire, light the wick. With each swaahaa, pour a=
 drop of melted ghee in the pot. Do everything else as in the procedure.

A=
s I said, homam with a big fire is better, but something is definitely bett=
er than nothing. Do deepa homam with a lamp and then meditate after poornaa=
huti. BTW, poornaahuti can be a spoonful of melted ghee.

One point I forgo=
t to make earlier:

If someone is buying a new house and looking for guidan=
ce, one more small factor. If homam is done in the northeast or east or sou=
theast corners of the house, it is better. One can look for a house that ha=
s a fireplace or balcony in those sides. Of course, those who already have =
a house and doing homam elsewhere need not worry. The key is to do it. Guid=
elines in shastras are for enhancing the experience a little and not for bl=
ocking it out of fear of breaking guidelines.

Best regards,
Narasimha
