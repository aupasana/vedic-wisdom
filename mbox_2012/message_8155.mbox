Hare Krishna Aravind Ji,
I am not a shastragya,but as being brought up in S=
anatana Dharma what i feel is that
=A0(1)Doing archana in temples means ser=
ving your upasya form of the Brahman through a learned priest when one know=
s not the rituals the same too can be done at home though,but what is signi=
ficant is that as temple is only meant for the service of the Deity and all=
 concerns revolve around Him/Her...it vibrates with auspicious energy and t=
he Brahman's Grace.
Now people may be of the opinion that many adulteration=
s and ill practices may too happen at a temple or we may not know whether i=
t is perfectly run by the priests...what is the validity of visiting such a=
 temple?
a perfectly reasonable question.
But there is also a sublime matte=
r that we forget...i too had this question? then my Maa once told me..."apa=
rt from the deity who presides the temple don't you see including us how ma=
ny kinds of people come here for invoking the Lord...for praying to him...m=
any of them may include siddhas,yoginis,mahatmans whose identities are hidd=
en from us...it is not possible in home to create space for all of them...b=
ut one of the prime significant purpose of the temple is also for the congr=
egation and assembly of such siddha men and women whose chants awakens the =
Garbha Griha and in whose sannidhya we are unknowingly blessed too...so it =
is not only a matter of whether the temple administrations is running a tem=
ple well...but also that the lord remains there for the assembly of those m=
any Bhaktas who come to visit"...
So this a viewpoint which my Maa has told=
 me keeping the temple darshan and archana at mind...and what are its signi=
ficance...keeping all the goods and patience that one may have to face whil=
e visiting a temple from a realistic viewpoint

apart from that it is perfe=
ctly ok to do archana in your home too as there is no place where the Lord =
is not there...and ekanta seva and personal service of the Lord is the most=
 important thing in sadhana...and it is in every way purna(complete) if you=
 are not visiting a temple and want to keep your practice and upasana to si=
mple personal level.


(2)Now comes the point that what is the significance=
 of archana itself...it is i feel...sacrificing all the material senses at =
the altar of God...it is like an external symbolism of surrendering our inn=
er senses the pancha or dasha indriyas...as whatever we give to God for eg:=
 in =A0pancha upacharas are pure gross consecrated matter which are used by=
 the five senses of the Human body to take pleasure, to feel,and as a whole=
 to survive...so externally surrending all the purest or the sattvic forms =
of whatever is being used =A0by the five senses...we internally surrender o=
urselves...as through external practices with its meaning well known comes =
internal awakening...and that what makes ritulas or archana of a vigraha or=
 symbol important.=A0

(3)The matter of offering names and gotras is done f=
or whose concern you are doing archana...if it is a kamya karma...meaning i=
f you are doing archana keeping in mind a wish to be fulfilled for yourself=
 or anybody...then give the names and gotras of all those for whose concern=
 you are performing it and no need for any seperate archana for all the per=
sons...if not(that is nishkama) then simply give your name and gotra or jus=
t say that =A0perform archana for the Lord and surrender.
Regular archana b=
y simple pancha upacharas at home makes a person disciplined and bestows hi=
m/her with a peaceful mind.

All the respected elders please do pardon me i=
f i have been wrong in my understanding and Aravindji =A0if i have failed t=
o answer your queries.anybody elses view on the matter would enlighten me t=
oo.

Prantik
