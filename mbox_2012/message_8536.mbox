Dear Laxmi Narayan ji,

Thank you for your email. I am doing fine and I hop=
e you are doing fine too.

Disagreements and difference of view-points are =
absolutely fine, afterall in ancient India from the monotheists to the athe=
ists, we had every breed coexisting. Having said that, I will explain a few=
 of the points you have raised in your email, from my perspective of course=
.


<<You have to complete the story.>.


The reason I cannot add anything =
more to it is because the individual himself did not reveal anything more a=
bout this.=C2=A0 For me, the incidents he revealed hold an interesting view=
-point and a value on its own. When I mention any such story I only narrate=
 the same exactly as it is, without adding or subtracting anything from it.=
 Conclusions, whatever they maybe, have to be drawn by every individual. So=
me may reject it, some may accept it, both of which are fine.

<<This story=
 seems to like I used to read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a=
 siddha if the 
story so far is true.and he has the ability to shape shift =
and transportation. So what?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang.>>
=

As per the Tantric scriptures, even Lord Shiva in his form of Bhairava smo=
kes ganja, drinks alcohol, eats with dogs and chandalas, roams around naked=
 in the smashana. So is taking intoxicants a sufficient criteria to judge a=
nyone's spirituality? Not for me! 

,

<<what does God mean in this tale? >=
>

I will tell you how I see it. In this story, God means infinity. Now wha=
t is infinity? It cannot be described, it cannot be named, it cannot be und=
erstood using the five sense organs. Science does not understand infinity, =
art does not understand infinity, nothing or nobody=C2=A0 understands infin=
ity. It is a summation of all that we know, all that we can imagine and all=
 that is impossible for us to imagine. It is an incomprehensible force that=
 runs through everything, from the most loveable to the most despicable , f=
rom the most holy to the most unholy, from the greatest saint to the stupid=
est piece of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean in the farthest planet=
 in the farthest solar system in the farthest universe. 


Now question is,=
 can an average human being "know" this mysterious and all pervading force?=
 Knowing implies understanding. Clearly no. Then how does one interact with=
 such a thing? One way is to consider everything, and I mean EVERYTHING fro=
m living to non-living, as a manifestation of that force and thus learn to =
love the same unconditionally without expecting anything in return. No wond=
er such unconditional love is not easy. It needs tremendous effort to chang=
e our own conditioning of the mind, and work on our inherent biases and pre=
judices. That is what the aim of sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself=
, to make one ready to be able to unconditionally love everything. The grea=
ter number of entities one can love unconditionally, that much little bit c=
loser one can come to interacting with the truly infinite. And those few ra=
re human beings who can love a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly=
 the closest to this supreme and unknowable force.
 In common language, we =
call them Rishis.

I like all forms of Deities, for I find something beauti=
ful in everyone of them. And I also like the One behind forms, which is so =
perfectly transcendental that it cannot be comprehended ever. It's like the=
 surface area of the fine tip of a needle, or the gap between the two breat=
hs, or the millionth part of a single hair, or the endless-ness of space, o=
r the bottomless well of stillness in the mind at certain points in meditat=
ion. The only thing that stops me from getting a better understanding the g=
randeur of this formless entity are the limitations of my own mind and body=
, that I have acquired over millions of births. That is why Sadhana. To slo=
wly gnaw away at my own mind, to be better able to appreciate this endless,=
 nameless entity. G_d.

I do not believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebi=
rth? If the Universe itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama and K=
rshna come back at every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not get bo=
rn? Infact, when a person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they me=
rely go to another plane in this Universe and stay there for eons of time, =
since time anyway moves very, very slowly in different realms. But then, if=
 this force so wants, it can send back any of the souls from any of the rea=
lms to any of the other realms to serve a certain function. And if a soul s=
tays in a certain higher realm and in forced to take rebirth again, the see=
ds of the karmas - which never really die off - are watered again by the en=
vironment of birth and they sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyo=
nd one cycle of creation. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very s=
ame enemies that they had been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Maha=
bharata says so.
 I believe it. 


What then is the final aim of all this, =
spirituality etc? I don't know. Maybe, to teach us to broaden our perspecti=
ves and consequentially lessen our attachments to our otherwise mundane liv=
es and its mundane problems. This is like a circular roller-coaster ride we=
 see in local melas. Tighten the seat-belts, bring a smile in the heart, be=
 detached and enjoy the show!

Best of luck and take good care of yourself!=


-Regards

=C2=A0 
Dear Rajarshi Bhai,
How are y=
ou? You have to complete the story. you have to tell what happened when X w=
ent to meet this man in temple.or anything else which happened. It is like =
somebody gone in kitchen to get rest of meal and not come back.

First I ha=
ve to thank you for writing that story about Divine Mother Sri Chinnmastaji=
. I had developed a fear about Her but 3 times I got spiritual indications =
over the period of 2 months that I should write my story. When you wrote ba=
ck suddenly my fear about Her melted away and I did immediate prayers to He=
r. Thanks.

The other thing is can I dare to say that I do not agree what i=
s in this thread. Why does this so called spiritual man has to dump his fai=
lure on religion. If people do not believe in religion or God or afterlife,=
 it is their problem. We are not all equal. We all do not come from same st=
ock. We are born with different conditions, go through different life exper=
iences and go where our fate or destiny takes us. This world is composed of=
 3 gunas and there is always going to tension of different sort. Why =C2=A0=
blame it on religion or God, why not on greed and desire to control others =
and lord over them using what ever mean.

This story seems to like I used t=
o read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a siddha if the story so=
 far is true.and he has the ability to shape shift and transportation. So w=
hat?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang.

what does God mean in thi=
s tale? Is it Creator God or Divine Lord Of Sri Vrindavan or =C2=A0Divine M=
other or =C2=A0Self Realisation or Universal God or Jewish God or Formless =
God or Fire God?? After all there was a dhoni fire there? Or some other God=
 ??

Sri Vrindavan has a rolling population. They are not in confusion. Man=
y people come there only for curiosity, many other come only for Darshan in=
 the Temple and go back home happy. many others come with different desires=
. It is very wrong to expect from a person who is in fifth grade to have kn=
owledge of 15th grade.

Many times people go to temple to pray and ask for =
certain things and if it does not happen they become very anti religion and=
 anti God. So what?? It has nothing to do with me or you or anybody else. I=
t is their life.

I was very very very ill. Nobody was helping me. Many peo=
ple were giving me lot of pain. =C2=A0I went from Religious place to religi=
ous place, temple to temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing seem to worked. =
Then I took up religious practise of doing mantra japa and other things whi=
ch are in scriptures and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It is totally re=
ligious discipline according to our scriptures.

Do you drive a car? Did yo=
u pass you exam first time? I do not drive a car. It will take me several e=
xams to pass it. Many people pass their test first time and drive successfu=
lly. Does it mean I should blame car or exams or examiner or road for my fa=
ilure??? .Many people take up spiritual life and if they do not find succes=
s quickly they blame religion and God.

I also used to think that a real ex=
perience of God would be very powerful thing. but there are other aspects t=
o it. If someone is totally dependent on Divine Mother and calls on Her day=
 and night, but yet he is not ready for certain energy or his body is not c=
lean enough to receive a new light, then Divine Mother would appear to him =
in very gentle way to comfort him and to console so that he remains on the =
path. She will appear right in front of him but he only sees the Golden Aur=
a and not what is middle of it because he is not yet ready. Whenever I thin=
k of that moment I am filled with deep bliss and joy and wonderment.

You a=
re a special person doing everyday intense haven to spread the light.Many o=
ther people in this group are doing haven everyday to fill their life with =
light of Divine Beings. This is a complete religious method which is also t=
otally spiritual thing.Please do not get impressed with pseudo spiritual ta=
lk and tales of shape shifting. Is everything alright in your everyday life=
 because I felt a sadness in your mail? I am sure I am very wrong in this.
=

Few days ago Olympic flame passed right outside my road.I did not go out t=
o see it. I kept holding to the Light which comes out of Divine Mothers Fee=
t hoping it will become permanent in my life.

Good Luck and =C2=A0Joy for =
you.

Dear Ajit,

I am in complete agreement with your thoughts.=C2=A0 A spiritu=
al man once said, "Religion has been created to shield people from God".=C2=
=A0

When I first heard this I was not convinced and thought it was some fa=
ke secularism. Lately I realized this is literally true. Heavy psychologica=
l constructs are created by religions to protect an average person from the=
 real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if and =
when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in your average life =
and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.


I will briefly narrate =
a true and interesting incident. 


An individual - say X - had gone to Vri=
ndavan to stay there for some years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famou=
s sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing u=
nblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing a=
t the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the rag=
ged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, "Maharaj, please=
 tell us some words of God". The man became angry, and retorted back, "Why?=
 Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all =
will run away. So please continue with your lectures as you were doing befo=
re I came in". Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile=
 the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky=
 and then got up and started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who =
was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, "He is a sadhu who comes t=
o Vrindavan once in a while,
 but he has probably lost his mental balance d=
ue to smoking too much ganja". Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird=
 reason felt attracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy=
 was going. As he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around =
and spoke to X in clear English, "Hello, I was waiting for you to come and =
join me." X was of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in E=
nglish and more over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew En=
glish (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). 


The man =
continued, "My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer=
 by profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu sin=
ce then." X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsa=
ng? Mr Iyengar replied, "All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself =
is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, no=
t ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all the religiou=
s troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little irritated, "Why do you have=
 so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu=
 for long, then how come you haven't met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is=
 it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there =
is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, mer=
ely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not=
 accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The root of
 all this proble=
m is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever.=
 What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. =
At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with s=
uper-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create =
this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernat=
ural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded by others as a man=
 of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem =
is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing =
that one has understood correctly." While talking, the sadhu stopped at a s=
mall tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chil=
lum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing=
 the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, "You (meaning X) are a young m=
an. Have a clear mind in your head, don't get
 confused by all these show o=
f spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of =
terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young ma=
n in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having nothi=
ng better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realize=
d what God really is and how to interact with this thing." As he spoke he r=
eached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a young girl came out of t=
he house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too =
come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay =
at their house. I will show you something interesting if you join me.


Aft=
er an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The wo=
man was bringing different fruits and sweets for their food while the young=
 girl was massaging Mr Iyengar's feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the=
 hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else=
 but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a househo=
lder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he=
 saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded=
 hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X =
was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turne=
d round to see what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in sho=
ck. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat =
on the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin =
was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up the
 whol=
e room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with en=
chantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being any more but a god s=
itting in place of what was even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-look=
ing Mr Iyengar.


X did not know what was happening. He saw the young man g=
estured towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotize=
d, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lo=
st all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a re=
mote location with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, =
held his hand and took him inside the temple precincts. There he saw a dhun=
i burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash=
 all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that meditat=
ing man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was tal=
king about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vr=
indavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After providing di=
rections of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again an=
d immediately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into=

 unconsciousness again. 


When X woke up, he was in the room in that hous=
e, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, wit=
h a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as direct=
ed.

Dear Prasanth,

> To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t=
 believe in any religion




In general, many of those who don't believe in=
 religion or God are being more honest than those who do. After all, most p=
eople who believe in God look at him as a limited being to barter with. All=
 of our biases and assumptions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods=
. Often, religion has simply served to formalize these biases.

While being=
 mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of insincere prayer =
can undo the whole weight of "paapa" that we engage in throughout the day. =
And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others look at all the suff=
ering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We "God believers" are=
 the culprit.

We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline=
. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both kin=
ds of fruits, we ask God to burn "paapa" and leave the "punya" intact. It i=
s us "God believers" who look at our lives, ignoring all the "paapa phala".=
 We look at one or two instances of "punya phala" and declare our prayers t=
o be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, and=
 laughs at us. We "God believers" are the culprit.

For the most part, our =
bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is p=
articularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When engaged in wor=
ldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And yet, we exp=
ect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly b=
hakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We "=
God believers" are the culprit.

The best way to bring about new waves of b=
hakti is not to look at the "non-believers" and try to convert them. All we=
 have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be honest with ours=
elves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be served.

If we see =
God as the limitless power that he is, he is difficult to define. It is dif=
ficult to capture him within a religion. Religion should see itself as a st=
epping-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on t=
op of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to=
 accept them without question. They ask us to place our heads on them with =
reverence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced from going any farth=
er.

v><br></div><div>I will tell you how I see it. In this story, God means inf=
inity. Now what is infinity? It cannot be described, it cannot be named, it=
 cannot be understood using the five sense organs. Science does not underst=
and infinity, art does not understand infinity, nothing or nobody  und=
erstands infinity. It is a summation of all that we know, all that we can
 =
imagine and all that is impossible for us to imagine. It is an incomprehens=
ible force that runs through everything, from the most loveable to the most=
 despicable , from the most holy to the most unholy, from the greatest sain=
t to the stupidest piece of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean in the =
farthest planet in the farthest solar system in the farthest universe. <br>=
</div><div><br></div><div>Now question is, can an average human being "know=
" this mysterious and all pervading force? Knowing implies understanding. C=
learly no. Then how does one interact with such a thing? One way is to cons=
ider everything, and I mean EVERYTHING from living to non-living, as a mani=
festation of that force and thus learn to love the same unconditionally wit=
hout expecting anything in return. No wonder such unconditional love is not=
 easy. It needs tremendous effort to change our own conditioning of the min=
d, and work on our inherent biases and prejudices. That is what the
 aim of=
 sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself, to make one ready to be able t=
o unconditionally love everything. The greater number of entities one can l=
ove unconditionally, that much little bit closer one can come to interactin=
g with the truly infinite. And those few rare human beings who can love a w=
hole universe unconditionally, are possibly the closest to this supreme and=
 unknowable force. In common language, we call them Rishis.<br><br>I like a=
ll forms of Deities, for I find something beautiful in everyone of them. An=
d I also like the One behind forms, which is so perfectly transcendental th=
at it cannot be comprehended ever. It's like the surface area of the fine t=
ip of a needle, or the gap between the two breaths, or the millionth part o=
f a single hair, or the endless-ness of space, or the bottomless well of st=
illness in the mind at certain points in meditation. The only thing that st=
ops me from getting a better understanding the grandeur of
 this formless e=
ntity are the limitations of my own mind and body, that I have acquired ove=
r millions of births. That is why Sadhana. To slowly gnaw away at my own mi=
nd, to be better able to appreciate this endless, nameless entity. G_d.</di=
v><div><br></div><div>I do not believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirt=
h? If the Universe itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama and Krs=
hna come back at every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not get born=
? Infact, when a person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they mere=
ly go to another plane in this Universe and stay there for eons of time, si=
nce time anyway moves very, very slowly in different realms. But then, if t=
his force so wants, it can send back any of the souls from any of the realm=
s to any of the other realms to serve a certain function. And if a soul sta=
ys in a certain higher realm and in forced to take rebirth again, the seeds=
 of the karmas - which never really die off - are
 watered again by the env=
ironment of birth and they sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyon=
d one cycle of creation. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very sa=
me enemies that they had been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Mahab=
harata says so. I believe it. <br></div><div><br></div><div>What then is th=
e final aim of all this, spirituality etc? I don't know. Maybe, to teach us=
 to broaden our perspectives and consequentially lessen our attachments to =
our otherwise mundane lives and its mundane problems. This is like a circul=
ar roller-coaster ride we see in local melas. Tighten the seat-belts, bring=
 a smile in the heart, be detached and enjoy the show!</div><div><br></div>=
<div>Best of luck and take good care of yourself!</div><div><br></div><div>=

I do not agree what is in this thread. Why does this so called spiritual ma=

 not come from same stock. We are born with different conditions, go throug=

div><span>Dear Ajit,</span></div><div><br><span></span></div><div><span>I a=
m in complete agreement with your thoughts.  A spiritual man once said=
, "Religion has been created to shield people from God". </span></div>=
<div><br></div><div>When I first heard this I was not convinced and thought=
 it was some fake secularism. Lately I realized this is literally true. Hea=
vy psychological constructs are created by religions to protect an average =
person from the real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelmi=
ng that if and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in you=
r average life and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.<br></div><=
div><br></div><div>I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident. =
<br></div><div><br></div><div>An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan=
 to
 stay there for some
 years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sa=
dhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unbli=
nking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at th=
e satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged =
looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, "Maharaj, please tel=
l us some words of God". The man became angry, and retorted back, "Why? Why=
 waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will=
 run away. So please continue with your lectures as you were doing before I=
 came in". Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the=
 sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and=
 then got up and started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was =
lecturing, looked at his followers and said, "He is a sadhu who comes to Vr=
indavan once in a while, but he has probably lost his mental balance due to=
 smoking too much
 ganja". Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird rea=
son felt attracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy was=
 going. As he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around and =
spoke to X in clear English, "Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join=
 me." X was of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in Engli=
sh and more over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew Englis=
h (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). <br></div><div>=
<br></div><div>The man continued, "My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near C=
hennai, was an Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have bee=
n a wondering sadhu since then." X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu =
who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, "All this is bogus. Actually=
 this God thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not t=
he hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reas=
on for all
 the religious troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little irr=
itated, "Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? =
If you have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven't met a single g=
enuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take=
 Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confu=
sed as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot =
meet that man, he is not accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The =
root of all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that ma=
n cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the huma=
n brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a=
 magnified woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, =
one day he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he ma=
y even acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be rega=
rded
 by others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say =
the root of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite =
mind and then stressing that one has understood correctly." While talking, =
the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pu=
ll finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 m=
inutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, "You (=
meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don't get confu=
sed by all these show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was yo=
ur age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I w=
as an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But th=
en one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 de=
cades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact with this t=
hing." As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a
 =
young girl came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar in=
turn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I c=
ome to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesti=
ng if you join me.<br></div><div><br></div><div>After an hour inside the ho=
use, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was bringing differe=
nt fruits and sweets for their food while the young girl was massaging Mr I=
yengar's feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought =
this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about=
 shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good=
 life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the man and th=
e woman and the girl  stood up and with folded hands were bowing down =
towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor=
, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turned round to see
 what was=
 going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old,=
 bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man,=
 who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, em=
anating a brilliant glow that lightened up the whole room. He had a shaved =
head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eye=
s! It looked not a human being any more but a god sitting in place of what =
was even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.<br></div=
><div><br></div><div>X did not know what was happening. He saw the young ma=
n gestured towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnot=
ized, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X=
 lost all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a=
 remote location with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearb=
y, held his hand and took him inside the temple precincts.
 There he saw a =
dhuni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with=
 ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that med=
itating man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was=
 talking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one i=
n Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After providin=
g directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X agai=
n and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed =
into unconsciousness again. <br></div><div><br></div><div>When X woke up, h=
e was in the room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the =
bed, his old, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, =
X went to the temple as directed. <br></div><div><br></div><div>-Regards</d=

    <div>Dear Prasanth,</div><div><br></div><div>> To those who say that=
 they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion<br><div><div><br></div><div><br=
></div><div>In general, many of those who don't believe in religion or God =
are being more honest than those who do. After all, most people who believe=
 in God look at him as a limited being to barter with. All of our biases an=
d assumptions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion=
 has simply served to formalize these biases.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Wh=
ile being mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of insincer=
e prayer can undo the whole weight of "paapa" that we engage in throughout =
the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others look at all=
 the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We "God belie=
vers" are the culprit.</div>

<div><br></div><div>We all have plenty of paa=
pa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to =
be steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn "paapa"=
 and leave the "punya" intact. It is us "God believers" who look at our liv=
es, ignoring all the "paapa phala". We look at one or two instances of "pun=
ya phala" and declare our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial o=
bserver sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We "God believers" are th=
e culprit.</div>

<div><br></div><div>For the most part, our bhakti is weak=
. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is particularly we=
ak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits,=
 our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And yet, we expect God to rew=
ard our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impa=
rtial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We "God believers"=
 are the culprit.</div>

<div><br></div><div>The best way to bring about ne=
w waves of bhakti is not to look at the "non-believers" and try to convert =
them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be hone=
st with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be served.=
</div>

<div><br></div><div>If we see God as the limitless power that he is=
, he is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture him within a religi=
on. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of =
us to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. U=
nfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them without question. They a=
sk us to place our heads on them with reverence, and try to prevent the spi=
ritually advanced from going any farther.</div>
