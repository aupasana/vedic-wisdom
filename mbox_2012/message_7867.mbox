Hello,
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I am sure=C2=
=A0there are several views=C2=A0on Jeevanmukti and its effect and other thi=
ngs but my take is that
if we do not experience certain extraordinary and m=
agical things ourselves all these remain only paper theory.
Those saints wh=
o are born to lift human beings have a=C2=A0different inner structure=C2=A0=
and=C2=A0they carry out their work through Divine Will but we cannot always=
 understand their inner feelings.
=C2=A0
Some years back Due to Divine Moth=
er's Grace a Light came and surrounded me one morning. I did not know
it ha=
s happened but my whole day was filled with deep bliss. I have lot of very =
difficult pain in my body yet I did 
not feel it on that day.Yet the pain w=
as there, it did not go away or diminsh but I did not feel it. There were o=
ther 
several problems yet I could not feel any tension or stress. I spent =
my day in a normal way yet all the time I was in a bliss. Funny enough I ke=
pt thinking that it is a normal everyday thing.
=C2=A0
The Light left me ne=
xt morning.
=C2=A0
As it left only then I realised that I was surrounded by=
 it=C2=A0and yesterday's bliss was=C2=A0directly due to it. I was back to m=
y normal self pain and and stress and all that. If anybody has ever been in=
 a large airconditioned building for several hours and then come out on str=
eet with heat and dust, the immediate impact on body and mind might 
convay=
 those feelings. If that Light had remain permanantly I am sure I would be =
a Jeevanmukt by now.
=C2=A0
Several year before it, I did prayers to Sri Ga=
neshji. Every wednesday I would=C2=A0cook myself=C2=A0besan moduk and then =
offer 
them to SriSri Ganeshji hoping He would cure me of my physical pain
=
.I did it nearly a year, then somehow stopped it as I thought nothing was h=
appening but kept doing Prayers
Several days later after I had my early mor=
ning prayers a similar sort energy came=C2=A0 and surrounded me. It was mor=
e intense but lasted a very short period . I knew it was SriSri Ganeshji kr=
ipa.
=C2=A0
The thing about white sugar is that when I made those besan Lad=
oo I used white sugar.=C2=A0 I use white sugar all the time and make sweet =
dishes and then offer them to Divine Beings.. Only recently I heard people =
saying that it has bone ash in it. Is it really true?? I mean is it really =
true? How much it would be in a one kilo bag of cane or beetroot sugar. Is =
it true only for western countries or India as well. In India in all the Te=
mples sweet dishes are made and offered to Deities. Does it mean there is b=
one ash in it if white sugar is used? Is there any way of removing it ?

Na=
maste - Well, I still don't get it. So Jeevanmukta is liberated from what ?=
 If he is going through janma, mrityu, jara and vyAdhi, what is he / she li=
berated from ?
The cases / scenarios you mention sound like the person has =
totally surrendered to will of the Supreme (Krsna, Siva, Shakti, Mother or =
whatever) and is in tune with the divine. If by liberation, we mean about t=
he consequences of the actions or other, may be.

Btw, do you call Arjuna j=
