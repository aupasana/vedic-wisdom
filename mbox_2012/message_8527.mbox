 - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to stay there for some years. He was sitti=

 is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is source of all confusion. No on=

 felt a little irritated, "Why do you have so much bitterness about religio=

n't met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?". Mr Iyengar replie=

, and generally be regarded by others as a man of god. But God is beyond th=
is. That is why I say the root of the problem is trying to understand the i=

ctly." While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought som=
e ganja, and in one pull finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a=
 kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. The=
n he continued, "You (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your=

how to interact with this thing." As he spoke he reached a two storied hous=

 general, many of those who don't believe in religion or God are being more=
 honest than those who do. After all, most people who believe in God look a=
t him as a limited being to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions =
are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has simply se=
rved to formalize these biases.

duality, we think that an ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weig=
ht of "paapa" that we engage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on=
 our God. No wonder that others look at all the suffering in the world and =
laugh at this concept of God. We "God believers" are the culprit.
> > 
> > =
We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of as=
king for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, w=
e ask God to burn "paapa" and leave the "punya" intact. It is us "God belie=
vers" who look at our lives, ignoring all the "paapa phala". We look at one=
 or two instances of "punya phala" and declare our prayers to be successful=
. However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. =
We "God believers" are the culprit.
> > 
> > For the most part, our bhakti =
is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is particul=
arly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When engaged in worldly pu=
rsuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And yet, we expect God=
 to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. =

bhakti is not to look at the "non-believers" and try to convert them. All w=

It is difficult to capture him within a religion. Religion should see itsel=
f as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our =
feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions =
ask us to accept them without question. They ask us to place our heads on t=
hem with reverence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced from going =
any farther.
