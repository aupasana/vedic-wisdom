Hi,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Vedas certainly wont entertain any kind of bodily trans=
fers as it is in practice in the modern era in the name of "Blood Donation"=
,=A0 "Eye Donation" & "Organ Donation" during alive or death for the purpos=
e of just a transplantation or medical experiments. There is a clear cut me=
thodologies after the death called "Uttara Shodasha Kriya" which has mature=
d scientific thoughts from several seers. It requires lot of elongated sess=
ions to make one understand why these kinds of transfusion is prohibited ac=
cording to our Dharmic rituals? So these transplantation are prohibited acc=
ording to Vedas, Sutras, Vedic Medical Science, theory of Karma Siddanta, S=
amskara Prakriyas and many more.

In puranas, if there is a story of transp=
lantation, one has to see the person, Social necessity, correct intention, =
etc., In case of Vajrayudha, no other way was there to put a full stop for =
the Vrtrasura's menace to Earth and Heaven. Only Dadhichi possessed the str=
ength of diamond in his back bone that was gained by thousands of years of =
Tapasya. Bone was removed as he was alive. Else Indra and other devatas wil=
l be summoned with "Brahma Hatya Dosha". So in every case of purana there w=
ill be lot of reasons!! not just the one being practiced blind fold now in =
the name of advanced science and technology which cannot touch the dust of =
seer's foot!!
