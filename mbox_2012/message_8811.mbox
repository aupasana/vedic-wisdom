Namaste,

I do not know of any book teaching mantra shastra, but perhaps th=
ese
exist... I would be most interested to hear what the others say.

This =
is an article about mantra shastra, though it does not quote a
particular b=
ook as it's source. Hope it's of some help. Perhaps mantra
shastra is knowl=
edge of mantra that is taught by the Guru to the
disciple.
