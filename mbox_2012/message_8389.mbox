This business of repeating God Name, that Nobody ji mentioned...it ain't no=
 joke ...doing it I mean! I tried today, and boy, it was hard...failed most=
ly, to be honest.

But every sage Ramakrishna, Anandamayi Ma, Ammachi, Siva=
nanda, Chaitanya, Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, every one of them was obsessed =
with this Name business. That means, there must be something to it.

I real=
ly want to take up Nobody ji's suggestion and get obsessed with the Name. I=
 firmly believe in it. I got sick (real sick) a few times, and the Name hel=
ped me (have had 2-3 black outs when I was unwell, long story, but basicall=
y, I was conscious during these black outs, and it felt like I was dying...=
and it sounds odd, but there were no thoughts except the Name "Keshava plea=
se help me" or "Narayana"). These episodes scared the bejesus out of me, an=
d each time I came out of them, I felt "I MUST DO MORE JAPA" it's the only =
thing that'll save me. All else is of no use when I'm in deep sh*t (pardon =
my language), the Name alone is reliable.

What I'm trying to say, is I wan=
t to devise some practical ways to get serious about this sadhana. 

Sivana=
nda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was a big fan of japa, and especially of Purascha=
rana (repeating mantra as many lakhs as there are syllables in the mantra. =
Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetitions). H=
e went on to say that 14 crore of japa with feeling would result in Darshan=
 of God in physical form, face to face. That would be great! Really wanted =
to do it...but when I did the maths, I worked out that, at the rate of 12 h=
ours japa a day, every single day from now on, it would take me till age 83=
 to finish this. :( 

But hey, I decided to make a start anyway, and began =
my my first Purascharana of the Om Namo Narayanaya mantra, in January this =
year, I am doing a measley 11 rounds a day, with my mind wandering most of =
the time (hard core people do hundreds of rounds with proper concentration =
daily). I'm a slow chanter, and need to say the mantra loudly or in a barel=
y audible whisper. My mental chanting is gradually improving but very diffi=
cult to do for more than 1-2 minutes. It's gonna take me till October 2013 =
to finish the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to take a 3 month break (and do 7 ro=
unds a day), and then start another Purascharana. 

Anyway, two things help=
 me get my 11 rounds of japa done every day when I'm at work/outdoors. Thou=
ght I'd mention it, if anybody's interested, just in case it's helpful. 

O=
ne is Telephone Japa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pretend I'm on the ph=
one. While doing this, I stick my hand in my pocket and count the japa on m=
y fingers. I get a couple of rounds done during my working day this way (I =
check carefully to make sure nobody's listening). Also while stuck in traff=
ic (while the car is NOT moving), I put my hands-free ear pieces on, and pr=
etend I'm chatting to a friend on the phone and do a couple of rounds. 

Th=
e other thing that I find useful (now please excuse the phrase), is "Toilet=
 japa". When I need to escape to do a round or two of japa at work, I excus=
e myself for a few minutes and lock myself up in a toilet cubicle. I then v=
ery very quietly mutter the mantra to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips moving,=
 no sound audible, in case anybody hears). I do about 2 sessions of this a =
day. This allows me to complete my 11 rounds a day, on days when my working=
 hours are long. 

I know this sounds bonkers, but I thought I'd mention th=
is for anyone else whose work life interferes with their japa. At least, it=
 provides a solution to doing a bit of japa at work.

If anybody else has a=
ny thoughts/suggestions, on how to repeat God' Name constantly, kindly shar=
e. 

Best wishes, and Om Namo Narayanaya, 

Aparna
