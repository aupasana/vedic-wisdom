...take some time and effort to learn about Her; visit Her in Her home (b=

 She will do anything for you. Once She has taken you on as Her child you w=

arm reception for you. Learn to see Her in every transformation-...........=
.and you will never be apart from Her. Open your heart to Her, and She will=
 never let you go.
