Hilarious story Utpal ji - love it. Wish getting Darshan was so easy!

No=
 no I don't hate Durga. She and Hari are my two favourite forms of the Divi=
ne. I'm even named after her, how can I hate her! But I wish I could live u=
p to my name- Parvati as Aparna did a great tapas- but my tapas is not quit=
e up to the mark. That's why I'm pissed off with her.

There is a generatio=
nal gap or some gap that has caused this misunderstanding- I'm 29 and belon=
g to this shocking generation of children who are not as polite to their pa=
rents and elders as they should be. This lack of politeness (sometimes) ext=
ends to the divine parents also. 

Thanks for the kind words Utpal ji, it's=
 much appreciated. I wish you speedy attainment of your Ishta. And you too =
Priya ji and others. :)

Regards,

Aparna
