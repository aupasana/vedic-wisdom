I am a very strong beloved of god and a very strong devotee. I love to wors=

 it. I always , always get negative & abusive thoughts and tie those to the=

foul language.

't give up praying him. I requested him several times to relive me from suc=

o pray him.=C2=A0
>Currently, my mind and it's racing evil & foul thoughts =
