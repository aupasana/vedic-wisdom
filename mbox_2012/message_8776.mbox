Namaste Rajarshiji,

That is a very interesting way of looking at a yantra.=
 I didn't know that before....thanks! I think most of us would agree with y=
our mail, that spiritual success depends on personal effort and God's grace=
.

As an aside, it really does feel that our 'personal' effort is also the =
Grace of God..! This is an age old statement....but of course, not meant as=
 an excuse not to work hard on ourselves.

I agree we have to keep striving=
....'personal' effort has to continue...what a mahabharatha this inner figh=
t is! Definitely need God as the charioteer for any chance of success.

Om =
Namo Narayanaya

Aparna
