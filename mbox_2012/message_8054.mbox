Sounds good, but there are points to disagree.

Anyways, another question t=
o ask would be who removes the veil; the self or a deity ? Or together ?

A=
lso, looks like having a veil is important to live in material world !

One tradition states that Arjuna re-incarnated as Kannappa (Bhakta Kannappa=
) who becomes a devotee of Shiva (remember that in Mahabharat itself the se=
ed for this was sown in an episode that Arjuna and Shiva fight for a wild b=
oar they hunted). It is in that Kannappa life that he attains to mukti at s=
rI kALahasti. In Kurukshetra war, Arjuna arrives at a certain state of unco=
nditioned awareness or consciousness due to the dilemma and circumstances o=
f the war and Krishna utilized that receptivity(arising out of utter helple=
ssness and hence willingness to surrender) to give him glimpses of the Vira=
t swarupam. You can liken the viswaroopam event to Ramakrishna making Naren=
dra experience divinity by placing his feet on the chest. 
>

asimha gAru's second post on jIvan mukta was relatively straight and clear =
on the concept. The other points I'll add is that action done by tri-karana=
s do result in consequence(s) to the doer (as long as the action was done w=
hile doer holds conditioned identity). All this accumulates in the sanchita=
 (warehouse) of the doer and a portion of it gets allotted as prarabdha for=
 a given life. This prarabdha one has to experience whether they are libera=
ted or not. Removal of conditioning does drop the entire Sanchita (breaks t=
he thread that is holding the Sanchita to the being) but prarabdha itself h=
olds as this was already allotted and in itself is the primary cause for th=
e embodied life of that being. If you drop prarabdha you drop the body and =
hence life too. Because that karmic structure is what glues the jIva and th=
e sarIra. A jIvan mukta had dropped all conditioning and hence his bondages=
 to all sanchita is gone. No new bondage is established for newer actions (=
agAmi) because the actions now are not conditioned by any kind of ignorance=
(mAya). These actions themselves can have consequences but they are not tie=
d to him and hence not attached/directed at him. They 'can' even attack the=
ir prArabdha to alter it if neeeded, but as they had already become pure wi=
tnesses than agenda driven conditioned individuals, they generally don't ge=
t into that and experience all of their prarabdha to let it burn naturally.=
 They also have capabilities to create and accumulate 'conscious and measur=
ed quantity and quality of sanchita' to be available as prarabdha for a fut=
ure life, if they intend to re-incarnate. However, whether the 'veil of mAy=
a' was put consciously by oneself or was eternally present as we forgot tha=
t we put it ourselves, as long as the veil is on us there will be an amount=
 of conditioning and ignorance. The main difference is that just as a man w=
ho puts a veil on his face sees blurred but is fully aware that he can anyt=
ime lift the veil at his own will to see through clearly, a re-incarnated a=
vatAra also knows that the veil of mAya was put on for a purpose and can be=
 dropped once the purpose is served. The case of rest of us is that of a ma=
n who put the veil a long time ago but totally forgot about that i.e. a) th=
at the veil exists and is interfering with his vision and b) that the veil =
was put by himself and it is within his own control to remove it. Hence we =
do all sadhana to recognize that distinction between the veil and ourselves=
 and thus drop the veil.
