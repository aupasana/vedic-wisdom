Namaste all, 


Sadhana

Some excerpts...

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
A=
 good sadhak will get results from any spiritual endeavor because they will=
 throw all of themselves into it, while a typical moron will not get any re=
sult even if they are given the most powerful mantra from the mouth of the =
greatest Guru. A pranam mantra in the heart of a true sadhak is powerful an=
d the universe shakes, while a bija mantra in the mouth of a idiot is power=
less. Who beats what, and not all 'who's" (in whoville) are equal. People t=
hrow about all kinds of words and lay down the campy wisdom speak, but when=
 push comes to shove they often reveal themselves. Time is either a redeeme=
r or a revealer.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

On=
e should never come out of sadhana the same being that they went into it. T=
here is always more to give of yourself and there is always a greater depth=
.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

People don't fee=
l this because they think they have time, but your going to be dead fairly =
soon. Then your going to flop around like a fish out of water when your ide=
ntity (you) gets crushed. A clever slogan or sly manipulation at this point=
 is meaningless. One is left with the (uncontrived) substance that is not u=
nder the control of thought. Unless a sadhana hits upon the substantive nat=
ure (substance in terms of reality which in a way is insubstantial), then a=
nything "gathered" is just more food for Death. Please understand that ther=
e will be no choices. Now is the time of choice, and one can choose to go a=
ll out or one can be a typical lukewarm fetishist who never fully commits.

some more hard knocks on that blog. wake up and get serious !!!
