Oh No Saranyan Ji,

Lalit Bhai saa'b is sending such =
hate mails since 2 years now. most on the list may not be knowing this fact=
.

At the moment he does not want to "understand". does not want to "See" t=
he big picture and forcefully convinces himself that Narasimha is a very bi=
g cheat and all the other who value him are fools who are destined to be do=
omed.

I pray for him that he becomes free from feeling of hatred as soon a=
s possible. Burden of hatred is one the most unbearable of all.

baki time =
pe hi sab kuch hoke rahega.

Best Regards,

Utpal

.=C3=82=C2=A0 Perfect equanimity in thoughts, words and deeds is the ultima=
te goal to be attained. Any thing else, any mystical experience etc, is hel=
pful to the extent that it aids this goal. If however, a mystical experienc=
e does not produce internal detachment and results in increasing pride (eve=
n subconscious pride) it can prove detrimental in the final equation.
