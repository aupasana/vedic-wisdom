Namaste friends,

I am cutting & pasting a small portion from the Satya Nar=
ayana vratam 
manual I am in the process of putting together. Those who kno=
w the 
ritual may know that we pray to Loka palakas (Ganesha, Brahma etc), =
nine 
planets and rulers of directions as a part of Satya Narayana vratam. =
The 
following text tries to explain the reason, i.e. what all those deitie=
s 
stand for. Just for your information..

Best regards,
Narasimha

In the field of duality, our consciousness operates =
due to three 
aspects: (1) Astitva or identity =E2=80=93 sense of =E2=80=9C=
I exist=E2=80=9D, (2) Bhoktritva or 
experiencership =E2=80=93 sense of =E2=
=80=9CI experience things=E2=80=9D, (3) Katritva or 
doership =E2=80=93 sen=
se of =E2=80=9CI do things=E2=80=9D.

We exist due to the five elements =E2=
=80=93 earth (solid state of existence), 
water (flexible state of existenc=
e), fire (transformatory state of 
existence), air (expansive state of exis=
tence) and ether (existential 
space behind all existence). These five elem=
ents are ruled by Ganapathi, 
Brahma, Lakshmi & Vishnu, Rudra and Gouri. So=
 we pray to them as they 
control our astitva or identity.

Literal meaning=
 of =E2=80=9Cgraha=E2=80=9D is one that grabs. We experience things as 
gra=
has or planets grab our consciousness and make it experience the 
results (=
reactions) of various actions performed by us in the past. 
Grahas are the =
agents of karma phala (fruits of previous actions). Thus, 
grahas control o=
ur bhoktritva or experiencership. So we pray to them, 
with ruling and co-r=
uling deities.

Ten dikpalakas rule the ten directions (eight 2-dimensional=
 directions, 
up and down). They not only rule the physical directions, but=
 the 
direction one takes in life with one's work. For example, in Vedic 
a=
strology, a chart called dasamsa shows one's work in society and the 
ten p=
arts of that chart are ruled by dikpalakas showing different kinds 
of work=
. Indra, for example, shows work that asserts authority and 
control over o=
thers (e.g. political leaders, managers). Agni, for 
example, shows work th=
at transforms things (e.g. engineers, designers). 
Yama shows work related =
to enforcing rules (e.g. quality assurance, 
police). Nirriti shows work th=
at breaks barriers (e.g. mafia, cutting 
edge innovations). And so on. It i=
s dikpalakas who control our kartritva 
or doership and make us perform dif=
ferent types of actions. So we pray 
to them.
