I have "The Supreme Yoga" - Yoga Vasistha by Swami Venkatesananda from
Mot=
ilal Banasidass Publishers. It has 365 pages marked for the dates of
calend=
ar, so you can also plan to read one page a day. I have read it
like that a=
fter my morning meditation and completed in a year, and
repeated it after c=
ouple of years.

Is that Best one ? I don't know as only one I have read. B=
ut I believe
that Yoga Vasistha by Swami Venkatesananda is fairly standard =
and
well-known.

Regards,

Mihir.
