I apologize to all for this very wide broadcast, but it seems there is no o=
ption. Please, to whoever started this email thread, it is NOT appropriate =
to add a thousand unwilling participants to the thread. Please exclude me f=
rom this thread. I have purposely subscribed to only the web-reading option=
, and not the email option, in many of the groups in this email list, becau=
se I can't afford my inbox to be flooded with these messages. Please send y=
our email only directly to the yahoogroups and WILLING direct participants.=
 That way, people can read them according to their configured options. This=
 is simple netiquette.

Regards,

Sundeep

Dear Lalit mishraj=
i,
Actually true,=C2=A0I agree,=C2=A0it is not our relgioun which has gone =
to the dogs=C2=A0 But it is the modern hindus who cannot identify the rules=
 of their own religons, who have gone to the dogs which means=C2=A0who only=
 know=C2=A0blind beliefs=C2=A0 or superstitions and cannot apply their spir=
itual discrinmination..
Thank you for the reminder of my mistake.. Our reli=
gon is truly glorious but, we, who practise it have=C2=A0truly degraded and=
 become hypocrites or pakhandi..

ge our sidereal system and convert it to purely sayan system which is not o=
ur traditional system. The system I am supportig is coordinative of both th=

 the various concepts namely sayan, nirayan and lunar fluctuations.
>>>>To =
satisfy all these divergent concepts our calendar reform system has develop=
ed the concept of Kalpa and Manwantar. The full precessional cycle of 360 d=

sent proposal is to shift maagha snana from poush purima to mrigasira purni=
ma and accordingly shift all festiavals by one whole month from fullmoon to=
 full moon and=C2=A0 amavasya to amavasya. This sort of quantized shift=C2=
=A0is the only way to maintain our nirayan system as well as to catch up wi=
th the seasons on monthly basis, say, every 2150 years, at a time..
