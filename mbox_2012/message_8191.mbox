Namaste,

I presume that your daughter is seeing you doing Homam regularly =
and now she has developed enough enthusiasm to do it herself independently.=


you can sit with her and initially try to help her managing the fire with=
 a wooden stick. Chinese Chop-stick is a very good option here. I myself us=
e it and find very comfortable. Let her manage the fire herself but you can=
 sit beside and intervene only if its needed.

I think you need not worry a=
bout Brahmacharya. I am sure many of us are not able to maintain absolute b=
rahmacharya. let her start doing homam with some regularity without having =
access baggage of "Brahmacharya" or such Dogmas at this tender age. Leave e=
verything related to homam in the hand of Jagadamba.

best wishes!

Utpal
