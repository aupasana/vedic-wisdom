Namaste,

Read a nice article on Swami Vivekananda by someone who knew him =
personally. Thought of sharing it here.

=C2=A0
REMINISCENCES OF SWAMI VIVE=
KANANDA 

BEFORE I knew Swamiji personally, I had heard much about
his grea=
tness from persons who had moved and lived with him
on the closest terms of=
 intimacy. Therefore, when it was
announced in the year 1893 that he had go=
ne over to America
to represent our religion at the Chicago Parliament of
R=
eligions, I started following his movements with the closest
attention and =
the greatest interest. I was anxiously waiting to
see if his achievements w=
ould not confirm me in my very high
estimate of him. I need not tell you, p=
eople of Madras, that
every bit of my expectation was much more than satisf=
ied. But
till I saw him with my own eyes, the perfect satisfaction of
knowi=
ng the man could not come. Till then I could not be
quite free from the sec=
ret misgivings that I might be after all
labouring under a delusion. So you=
 see, gentlemen, that I did
not meet Swamiji as one in any way biased again=
st him. The
throbbing interest and convincingness which attach to the
glowi=
ng description of the conquest of opponents of a great
man of overmastering=
 personality does not belong to my
subject. I may say, I was already a grea=
t admirer of his. But I
must say at the same time that it was not too late =
in the day to
retrace my steps and give Swamiji up as one unworthy of my
lo=
ve and esteem if facts were found to give the lie. Perhaps,
the shock which=
 such a disclosure would have given to my
mind would be too painful; perhap=
s it would have cost a great
drenching of the heart. But I can assure you t=
hat the instinct of
moral self-preservation was yet stronger than my admira=
tion
of Swamiji, and cost how much it would, the heart could not
long cling=
 round him if reason and moral sense condemned
him with one voice.
And what=
 was the nature of the greatness I was expecting to
see in Swamiji? It was =
not the dashing and daring spirit
displayed by a heroic warrior on the batt=
lefield, nor the fine ethereal vision and ecstasy of the poet, nor the vast=
 erudition
of a scholar, nor the dazzling intellectual flourish of the mast=
er
controversialist, nor the quick penetration and the wide
comprehension o=
f the philosopher, nor the weeping heart of a true
lover of humanity. It wa=
s not that I had not had enough
testimony as to these qualities of head and=
 heart being
abundantly present in him, but because my conception of religi=
on
was not wide enough to include all these under it. His
marvellous achiev=
ements in the West were bringing us
overwhelming evidences of his wonderful=
 intellectual powers. But
either from some constitutional necessity or my e=
xtreme
poverty in that direction I was always attributing the brightness of=

his intellect to his highly elevated religious life, and it was this
relig=
ious life that I expected to see in him. My idea of religion
was then confi=
ned to purity and meditation. Sitting at the feet
of the holy and good disc=
iples of Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna,
I had learnt that these two were the in=
dispensable conditions
of acquiring spirituality and are the sure marks by =
which a
religious man can always be known. My debt of gratitude to
the bles=
sed Swamis, at whose feet I had learnt these great
lessons, is too large to=
 be repaid. Personal contact with
Swamiji instead of diminishing the value =
of purity and
meditation in my eyes, has only enhanced it. At the same time=
 it has
heightened and intensified my conception of religion by
adding new =
elements to it. Till I came in personal contact with
Swamiji my temperament=
 had led me to expect to see in him a
man of intense purity and meditative =
inwardness. And I need
not tell you that I was not disappointed. The First =
sight of
Swamiji, the peculiar brightness of his face, his lustrous yet
sof=
t and sweet eyes, at once carried into my heart an
overwhelming sense of sa=
tisfaction that I had come to a man that
like of whom I had never seen befo=
re. Then when he began to
talk to us making personal inquiries and giving u=
s words of
hope and encouragement with the cordiality of one truly
interest=
ed in our welfare, we felt that our hearts were being
drawn closer to him. =
To us who were very insignificant
compared with his friends and visitors wh=
o were standing or sitting ground him in large numbers, this kindness on hi=
s part filed us
with great joy and gratitude. Then the wonderfully free and=

frank way in which he was talking to his visitors revealed to us
a heart t=
hat knew nothing of guile or fear nor cared a bit for
social conventionalit=
y. The transparently clear and pointed
words that were shooting out of his =
lips like meteors gave us a
peep into the keen penetration of his intellect=
 and the breadth
and profundity of his mental vision. We felt ourselves in =
the
presence of an overpowering personality whose immensity it
was not poss=
ible for us to gauge, but which was drawing us to
itself as by a tie of clo=
se personal relationship. There arose on
the first day of our meeting an ex=
cellent opportunity of
knowing something of his real humility. I say real h=
umility because
it had nothing to do with that sense of self-abasement with=
 its
external manifestation of facial contortions which so often
pass for h=
umility. It was self-effacement and was not therefore
without the charming =
dignity of self-respect. A question from
one of the visitors as to why Swam=
iji's lecture on his Master
delivered in America had not seen the light of =
day, brought
the bold confession: "I did not allow it to be published as I =
had
done injustice to my Master. My Master never condemned
anything or anyb=
ody. But while I was speaking of him I
criticized the people of America for=
 their dollar-worshipping
spirit. That day I learnt the lesson that I am no=
t yet fit to talk of
him." These words were really startling to us for more=
 than
one reason. Here was a man who was being idolized, nay
actually worsh=
ipped by so many, and this man in their very
presence confessing his inabil=
ity to represent his guru! "What
an unpretentious man is before us", said w=
e to ourselves.
"What a wonderful man must his guru have been to occupy
suc=
h a high place in the heart of this great man!"
This, in short, was my impr=
ession of Swamiji on the first day
of our meeting. As days went and I knew =
more and more of
him, it gained greater and greater strength. I only saw on=
 the
first day the few sparks that shot forth into our range of vision
from=
 a soul aglow with the fire of divine love and wisdom. It
was yet in store =
for me to see many more sparks from the same source that drew me near to it=
, gave me a closer view of it, and
enabled even my icy cold heart to posses=
s a little of its warmth.
I have already told you that I had always thought=
 that
Swamiji's gigantic intellect was the result of his highly elevated li=
fe of
purity. Greater acquaintance with him was making my belief
stronger t=
ill one day his own words made it a settled conviction
with me. It was a me=
morable evening in my life, which shall
never be effaced from my mind, when=
 a question from one of
his would-be disciples brought forth an exhaustive =
and stirring
discourse on brahmacharya or sexual purity. In the course of
t=
he discourse he was explaining to us the incalculable value of
purity in re=
ligious life, how to practise it, how religious
fervour, suddenly aroused b=
y working on the emotional side of
man to the utter neglect of the moral an=
d intellectual, is apt to
produce great reaction on the sexual desires and =
so forth.
Then at last when he came to talk of the infinite powers of
stric=
t sexual purity and how the animal propensity is converted
into spiritual m=
ight, he warmed up to such a high pitch of
earnestness that it seemed as if=
 the transparent soul within was
flowing out in torrents through his lips, =
bathing its hearers
with its heavenly waters. The picture that was being dr=
awn by
his words in our minds saw its own prototype in the figure that
stoo=
d before us. And I leave it to you, gentlemen, to imagine
the effect of the=
se concluding words of the discourse upon us:
"My Master had told me that i=
f I could attain to the perfect
state of purity I had just described. I wil=
l have spiritual insight.
I ventured to stand before the world only when I =
had been
satisfied that I had attained to it. I earnestly appeal to you, my=

boys, to keep to this ideal with adamantine firmness. Pray, do
not be unwo=
rthy of me. "On another occasion too I heard him
speak of his spiritual ins=
ight which could at once see the end of
a thing hidden in the womb of futur=
ity, of which the beginning
is only made. I must not be understood to mean =
that
intellectual brightness is always a sign of spirituality. A man may ha=
ve
a great intellect without being in the least spiritual. On the
other han=
d a man may be spiritual without having his mind
stored with informations, =
vast and varied, or without the power to put his words in a logical form. B=
ut truth will always
be his and will flash upon his mind of itself. My pres=
ent idea of
Swamiji's intellect has undergone some modification from
what i=
t was before I knew him personally. He combined in him
spiritual insight wi=
th an intellect of the highest order. Truth
came to him by intuition. But h=
e would press his intellect into
its service by giving it a logical form an=
d making it convincing
by a rich supply of facts and analogies stored in hi=
s brain.
And the purity which gave Swamiji this spiritual insight was
somet=
hing extraordinary. It was not the fragile purity that can
protect itself b=
y keeping itself away from all corrupting
influences. It had long outgrown =
the need of the citadel of
isolation. But that was not all. It became aggre=
ssive, taking a sort
of delight in encountering its enemies on their own gr=
ounds
and winning them over to its side. In other words, it could not
only =
keep itself untouched amidst corrupting influences, but
could turn them int=
o positive powers for good. Gentlemen, I
cannot go into personal details on=
 a subject like this. But my
knowledge of Swamiji's marvellous achievements=
 in this
direction compels me to lay at his feet my deepest reverence;
this=
 one element of perfection in Swamiji would have been
quite enough to compe=
l me to give him the highest place in my
heart.
...There was one more promi=
nent feature of Swamiji's life
which speaks to me volumes about his renunci=
ation. I mean
his dealing with rich men. Many of you are aware that among
h=
is foreign disciples some are very wealthy and a few of them
came out to In=
dia to help Swamiji in his work. The treatment
which he used to give them d=
id not in the least differ from that
given to his most insignificant Indian=
 disciples. He was kind
and loving by nature to all, but his love did not m=
ake him blind
to their flaws and defects which needed mending.
Gentle speec=
h would not always serve the purpose, and
Swamiji would have to be at times=
 hard. And in this
apparently unpleasant treatment, his wealthy disciples w=
ould have
exactly the same fate as his begging sannyasins. At times, this
w=
ould be too much for persons born and brought up in the lap of luxury and a=
ccustomed to hear words of praise and flattery
>From a worldly point of view=
, Swamiji paid dear for it. But did
he ever regret? Far from it. The perfec=
t unconcern which he
showed whether rich people would stick to him or give =
him up
is truly unprecedented.
...Of the few pregnant proverbs and epigramm=
atical
expressions which Swamiji would never be tired of repeating,
one was=
 "  =E2=80=94 The giver of the head is alone the
leader", that is, he atone=
 can be a leader who is ready to die for
others. And Swamiji's own life det=
ermines his place among his
fellow beings. I have already told you that Swa=
miji was not
only kind and soft but was very hard also at times. He could
n=
ot only lay down his life for others, but could take arms
against others if=
 needed. Whatever he would think or feel he
would do so with wonderful vehe=
mence and intensity. And
this whole-souledness was another marked feature o=
f
Swamiji's life. One evening in the course of a talk that Swamiji was
givi=
ng to one of his disciples, opening his eyes to the fact that
the disciple'=
s inability to manage the servants of the Math
(which was one of his duties=
 then) and make them do their
respective duties was a weakness and did not =
proceed from
love, he said, "Don't think that your heart is full of love,
b=
ecause you cannot give them a little scolding now and then.
Can you give yo=
ur life for them? I know, you can't, because
you do not love them. This min=
ute I can die for them; but also
I can hang them on this tree this minute i=
f need be. Can you do
that? No, my boy, namby-pamby is not love. Remember t=
he
words of the poet,  =E2=80=94'Harder than the thunderbolt and softer tha=
n the flower', this is the ideal,
No, love is not weak sentimentality."
I h=
ave seen no man who could be so soft as Swamiji. The
death of a gurubhai or=
 a disciple would rob him of rest and
consolation for days and days togethe=
r. Some time in the year
1898, it pleased the Lord to take away one of his =
gurubhais.
The pang of bereavement was so intense in Swamiji that for
week =
he remained exceedingly heavy and absent-minded
keeping as much away from o=
thers as possible. On the evening of the seventh or eighth day he came to t=
he temple-room of the
Math, and began to talk to those that were present th=
ere, like
a simple child: "I did not come to the temple these days
because =
I was very angry with my Master for having deprived
me of my dear brother. =
I love them so much because I have
lived longer and more intimately with th=
em than even with my
own brothers.... But why should I be angry with my Mas=
ter?
Why should I expect that all things will be ordained according
to my w=
ishes? And why should I be sad at all? Am I not a
hero? My Master used to s=
ay laying his arm upon my shoulder:
Naren, you are a hero; the very sight o=
f you inspires me with
courage.' Yes, I am a hero. Why should I then give w=
ay to
grief?"
...Ask each one of his disciples, American or English,
Bengal=
i or Madrasi, and you will hear the same thing from all
that their hearts w=
ere won by Swamiji's wonderful love and
sympathy. Swamiji's marvellous inte=
llectual powers, no
doubt, evoked the awe of all. But this awe would have k=
ept at
a distance all unintellectual people like myself and would have
prov=
ed more a barrier than a help to them to come in direct
touch with him and =
drink from the fountain of his soul. Heaps
of instances could be cited to s=
how Swamiji's wonderful heart.
...And how can universal love be without the=
 ever present
consciousness of the closest kinship with the universe, witho=
ut
the realization that whatever is is mine, nay, whatever is is
me? And th=
is is brahmajnana (knowledge of Self) as our holy
books describe it. This i=
s the very core of Swamiji's teaching =E2=80=94
The Selfhood of all =E2=80=
=94 the Divinity of man. And this is, I am
fully convinced, the key to his =
wonderfully versatile nature.
He was a lover of all, because he was a jnani=
. And here I must
tell you that the fatal illusion under which I had long l=
aboured
that jnana and bhakti are destructive of each other, dispersed
in t=
he presence of Swamiji as darkness before the sun. Swamiji
was a tremendous=
 worker because he was a bhakta and jnani.
The tremendous energy that shook=
 the whole world and is still
at work awakening many a slumbering soul to i=
ts innate Divinity,
instilling life into dead bones, bringing sunshine in t=
he darkness of despair and love in dry, arid souls =E2=80=93, this
tremendo=
us energy owes its origin to his realization of brahman in all.
Here too, I=
 must tell you that the fatally-erroneous idea that karma is antagonistic t=
o jnana and bhakti is dispelled at once
by the life of Swamiji.
I told you =
at the outset that before I met Swamiji I did not,
on account of my limited=
 religious views, expect to see in him
anything of the warrior, the poet, t=
he philosopher, or the
philanthropist. But I found that he was all these an=
d more than
these. He was as much a poet as a philosopher; as much a
sentim=
ental visionary as a man of action. And he was all these,
not in spite of h=
is religion but on account of it.
I have learnt that a religion which does =
not call forth into
vigorous activity and chasten and elevate the moral,
in=
tellectual, and aesthetic faculties of man, make him humane and
self-sacrif=
icing and at the same lime self-absorbed and
meditative is an imperfect rel=
igion. But I have also learnt that even
such imperfect religions have their=
 great purpose to serve in
helping the growth of persons less evolved and t=
hat our
attitude towards them all should he one of extreme sympathy and
lov=
e. I have learnt that I should hesitate thrice before I
condemn any form of=
 religious faith, however repellent it may
appear to me. For I have seen fo=
rms of worship, generally
condemned as superstitious, yield treasurers of i=
nfinite beauty
and holiness touched by the magic wand of Swamiji. I have
le=
arnt that every individual, however degraded he may appear
in my eyes, is G=
od involved, and therefore cannot be lost for
ever. We should look upon him=
 with respect and if possible
give him a lift Godward, not by condemning hi=
s perverted
ideal and by cruelly tearing it away from his heart but by gent=
ly
replacing it by a true one suited to his temperament and
culture. I have=
 learnt that under peculiar circumstances even
hardness and cruelty become =
a virtue, stubborn resistance.
and excellence, and that activity is as much=
 a help to spiritual
growth as contemplative calmness. I have learnt that G=
od can
be enjoyed both within ourselves and outside of ourselves;
within ou=
rselves by effacing completely from our consciousness all impression of the=
 world of senses and making me
Spirit touch Spirit. Outside ourselves by se=
eing God in
everything and pouring out our hearts unto His feel in the shap=
e of
loving service. I have learnt the incalculable value of great
personal=
ities in the scheme of individual, national, and
universal redemption. I ha=
ve also learnt that I have learnt all these
only intellectually and am yet =
far from getting them woven
into my nature. And all these I have learnt fro=
m the life of
Swamiji. One thing more: My conviction that Swamiji's
spiritu=
al realization was of the highest order came to me not only
from his intens=
e purity, fearlessness, love of truth, and
universal sympathy, but also fro=
m those subtler personal
manifestations described in our shastras. I have s=
een him weep like a
child and becoming disconsolate at the name of God. I h=
ave
seen him go into such deep meditation that even the function
of the lun=
gs stopped. Last of all came his own words to give the
finishing touch to m=
y conception of his spiritual greatness....

displayed by a heroic warrior on the battlefield, nor the fine

ethe=
real vision and ecstasy of the poet, nor the vast erudition
of a scholar, n=
or the dazzling intellectual flourish of the master
controversialist, nor t=
he quick penetration and the wide
comprehension of the philosopher, nor the=
 weeping heart of a true
lover of humanity. It was not that I had not had e=
nough
testimony as to these qualities of head and heart being
abundantly pr=
esent in him, but because my conception of religion
was not wide enough to =
include all these under it. His
marvellous achievements in the West were br=
inging us
overwhelming evidences of his wonderful intellectual powers. But
=
either from some constitutional necessity or my extreme
poverty in that dir=
ection I was always attributing the brightness of
his intellect to his high=
ly elevated religious life, and it was this
religious life that I expected =
to see in him. My idea of religion
was then confined to purity and meditati=
on. Sitting at the feet
of the holy and good disciples of Bhagavan Shri Ram=
akrishna,
I had learnt that these two were the indispensable conditions
of =
acquiring spirituality and are the sure marks by which a
religious man can =
always be known. My debt of gratitude to
the blessed Swamis, at whose feet =
I had learnt these great
lessons, is too large to be repaid. Personal conta=
ct with
Swamiji instead of diminishing the value of purity and
meditation i=
n my eyes, has only enhanced it. At the same time it has
heightened and int=
ensified my conception of religion by
adding new elements to it. Till I cam=
e in personal contact with
Swamiji my temperament had led me to expect to s=
ee in him a
man of intense purity and meditative inwardness. And I need
not=
 tell you that I was not disappointed. The First sight of
Swamiji, the pecu=
liar brightness of his face, his lustrous yet
soft and sweet eyes, at once =
carried into my heart an
overwhelming sense of satisfaction that I had come=
 to a man that
like of whom I had never seen before. Then when he began to
=
talk to us making personal inquiries and giving us words of
hope and encour=
agement with the cordiality of one truly
interested in our welfare, we felt=
 that our hearts were being
drawn closer to him. To us who were very insign=
ificant
compared with his friends and visitors who were standing or sitting=


ground him in large numbers, this kindness on his part filed us
with grea=
t joy and gratitude. Then the wonderfully free and
frank way in which he wa=
s talking to his visitors revealed to us
a heart that knew nothing of guile=
 or fear nor cared a bit for
social conventionality. The transparently clea=
r and pointed
words that were shooting out of his lips like meteors gave us=
 a
peep into the keen penetration of his intellect and the breadth
and prof=
undity of his mental vision. We felt ourselves in the
presence of an overpo=
wering personality whose immensity it
was not possible for us to gauge, but=
 which was drawing us to
itself as by a tie of close personal relationship.=
 There arose on
the first day of our meeting an excellent opportunity of
kn=
owing something of his real humility. I say real humility because
it had no=
thing to do with that sense of self-abasement with its
external manifestati=
on of facial contortions which so often
pass for humility. It was self-effa=
cement and was not therefore
without the charming dignity of self-respect. =
A question from
one of the visitors as to why Swamiji's lecture on his Mast=
er
delivered in America had not seen the light of day, brought
the bold con=
fession: "I did not allow it to be published as I had
done injustice to my =
Master. My Master never condemned
anything or anybody. But while I was spea=
king of him I
criticized the people of America for their dollar-worshipping=

spirit. That day I learnt the lesson that I am not yet fit to talk of
him.=
" These words were really startling to us for more than
one reason. Here wa=
s a man who was being idolized, nay
actually worshipped by so many, and thi=
s man in their very
presence confessing his inability to represent his <i>g=
uru</i>! "What
an unpretentious man is before us", said we to ourselves.
"W=
hat a wonderful man must his <i>guru</i> have been to occupy
such a high pl=
ace in the heart of this great man!"</div>

<div>This, in short, was my imp=
ression of Swamiji on the first day
of our meeting. As days went and I knew=
 more and more of
him, it gained greater and greater strength. I only saw o=
n the
first day the few sparks that shot forth into our range of vision
fro=
m a soul aglow with the fire of divine love and wisdom. It
was yet in store=
 for me to see many more sparks from the same

source that drew me near to =
it, gave me a closer view of it, and
enabled even my icy cold heart to poss=
ess a little of its warmth.
I have already told you that I had always thoug=
ht that
Swamiji's gigantic intellect was the result of his highly elevated =
life of
purity. Greater acquaintance with him was making my belief
stronger=
 till one day his own words made it a settled conviction
with me. It was a =
memorable evening in my life, which shall
never be effaced from my mind, wh=
en a question from one of
his would-be disciples brought forth an exhaustiv=
e and stirring
discourse on <i>brahmacharya</i> or sexual purity. In the co=
urse of
the discourse he was explaining to us the incalculable value of
pur=
ity in religious life, how to practise it, how religious
fervour, suddenly =
aroused by working on the emotional side of
man to the utter neglect of the=
 moral and intellectual, is apt to
produce great reaction on the sexual des=
ires and so forth.
Then at last when he came to talk of the infinite powers=
 of
strict sexual purity and how the animal propensity is converted
into sp=
iritual might, he warmed up to such a high pitch of
earnestness that it see=
med as if the transparent soul within was
flowing out in torrents through h=
is lips, bathing its hearers
with its heavenly waters. The picture that was=
 being drawn by
his words in our minds saw its own prototype in the figure =
that
stood before us. And I leave it to you, gentlemen, to imagine
the effe=
ct of these concluding words of the discourse upon us:
"My Master had told =
me that if I could attain to the perfect
state of purity I had just describ=
ed. I will have spiritual insight.
I ventured to stand before the world onl=
y when I had been
satisfied that I had attained to it. I earnestly appeal t=
o you, my
boys, to keep to this ideal with adamantine firmness. Pray, do
no=
t be unworthy of me. "On another occasion too I heard him
speak of his spir=
itual insight which could at once see the end of
a thing hidden in the womb=
 of futurity, of which the beginning
is only made. I must not be understood=
 to mean that
intellectual brightness is always a sign of spirituality. A m=
an may have
a great intellect without being in the least spiritual. On the
=
other hand a man may be spiritual without having his mind
stored with infor=
mations, vast and varied, or without the

power to put his words in a logic=
al form. But truth will always
be his and will flash upon his mind of itsel=
f. My present idea of
Swamiji's intellect has undergone some modification f=
rom
what it was before I knew him personally. He combined in him
spiritual =
insight with an intellect of the highest order. Truth
came to him by intuit=
ion. But he would press his intellect into
its service by giving it a logic=
al form and making it convincing
by a rich supply of facts and analogies st=
ored in his brain.</div>

<div>And the purity which gave Swamiji this spiri=
tual insight was
something extraordinary. It was not the fragile purity tha=
t can
protect itself by keeping itself away from all corrupting
influences.=
 It had long outgrown the need of the citadel of
isolation. But that was no=
t all. It became aggressive, taking a sort
of delight in encountering its e=
nemies on their own grounds
and winning them over to its side. In other wor=
ds, it could not
only keep itself untouched amidst corrupting influences, b=
ut
could turn them into positive powers for good. Gentlemen, I
cannot go in=
to personal details on a subject like this. But my
knowledge of Swamiji's m=
arvellous achievements in this
direction compels me to lay at his feet my d=
eepest reverence;
this one element of perfection in Swamiji would have been=

quite enough to compel me to give him the highest place in my
heart.</div>=


<div>...There was one more prominent feature of Swamiji's life
which spea=
ks to me volumes about his renunciation. I mean
his dealing with rich men. =
Many of you are aware that among
his foreign disciples some are very wealth=
y and a few of them
came out to India to help Swamiji in his work. The trea=
tment
which he used to give them did not in the least differ from that
give=
n to his most insignificant Indian disciples. He was kind
and loving by nat=
ure to all, but his love did not make him blind
to their flaws and defects =
which needed mending.</div>

<div>Gentle speech would not always serve the =
purpose, and
Swamiji would have to be at times hard. And in this
apparently=
 unpleasant treatment, his wealthy disciples would have
exactly the same fa=
te as his begging <i>sannyasins</i>. At times, this
would be too much for p=
ersons born and brought up in the lap

of luxury and accustomed to hear wor=
ds of praise and flattery
>From a worldly point of view, Swamiji paid dear f=
or it. But did
he ever regret? Far from it. The perfect unconcern which he
=
showed whether rich people would stick to him or give him up
is truly unpre=
cedented.</div>

<div>...Of the few pregnant proverbs and epigrammatical
ex=
pressions which Swamiji would never be tired of repeating,
one was "

<img =
src=3D"http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/reminiscences/307_sv_1.jpg" a=
lign=3D"ABSMIDDLE" height=3D"16" width=3D"67">

=E2=80=94 The giver of the =
head is alone the
leader", that is, he atone can be a leader who is ready t=
o die for
others. And Swamiji's own life determines his place among his
fel=
low beings. I have already told you that Swamiji was not
only kind and soft=
 but was very hard also at times. He could
not only lay down his life for o=
thers, but could take arms
against others if needed. Whatever he would thin=
k or feel he
would do so with wonderful vehemence and intensity. And
this w=
hole-souledness was another marked feature of
Swamiji's life. One evening i=
n the course of a talk that Swamiji was
giving to one of his disciples, ope=
ning his eyes to the fact that
the disciple's inability to manage the serva=
nts of the Math
(which was one of his duties then) and make them do their
r=
espective duties was a weakness and did not proceed from
love, he said, "Do=
n't think that your heart is full of love,
because you cannot give them a l=
ittle scolding now and then.
Can you give your life for them? I know, you c=
an't, because
you do not love them. This minute I can die for them; but als=
o
I can hang them on this tree this minute if need be. Can you do
that? No,=
 my boy, namby-pamby is not love. Remember the
words of the poet,

<img src=
=3D"http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/reminiscences/307_sv_2.jpg" alig=
n=3D"ABSBOTTOM" height=3D"17" width=3D"156">

=E2=80=94'Harder than the thu=
nderbolt and softer than the flower', this is the ideal,
No, love is not we=
ak sentimentality."</div>

<div>I have seen no man who could be so soft as =
Swamiji. The
death of a <i>gurubhai</i> or a disciple would rob him of rest=
 and
consolation for days and days together. Some time in the year
1898, it=
 pleased the Lord to take away one of his <i>gurubhais</i>.
The pang of ber=
eavement was so intense in Swamiji that for
week he remained exceedingly he=
avy and absent-minded
keeping as much away from others as possible. On the =
evening

of the seventh or eighth day he came to the temple-room of the
Mat=
h, and began to talk to those that were present there, like
a simple child:=
 "I did not come to the temple these days
because I was very angry with my =
Master for having deprived
me of my dear brother. I love them so much becau=
se I have
lived longer and more intimately with them than even with my
own =
brothers.... But why should I be angry with my Master?
Why should I expect =
that all things will be ordained according
to my wishes? And why should I b=
e sad at all? Am I not a
hero? My Master used to say laying his arm upon my=
 shoulder:
Naren, you are a hero; the very sight of you inspires me with
co=
urage.' Yes, I am a hero. Why should I then give way to
grief?"</div>

<div=
>...Ask each one of his disciples, American or English,
Bengali or Madrasi,=
 and you will hear the same thing from all
that their hearts were won by Sw=
amiji's wonderful love and
sympathy. Swamiji's marvellous intellectual powe=
rs, no
doubt, evoked the awe of all. But this awe would have kept at
a dist=
ance all unintellectual people like myself and would have
proved more a bar=
rier than a help to them to come in direct
touch with him and drink from th=
e fountain of his soul. Heaps
of instances could be cited to show Swamiji's=
 wonderful heart.</div>

<div>...And how can universal love be without the =
ever present
consciousness of the closest kinship with the universe, withou=
t
the realization that whatever is is mine, nay, whatever is is
me? And thi=
s is <i>brahmajnana</i> (knowledge of Self) as our holy
books describe it. =
This is the very core of Swamiji's teaching =E2=80=94
The Selfhood of all =
=E2=80=94 the Divinity of man. And this is, I am
fully convinced, the key t=
o his wonderfully versatile nature.
He was a lover of all, because he was a=
 <i>jnani</i>. And here I must
tell you that the fatal illusion under which=
 I had long laboured
that <i>jnana</i> and <i>bhakti</i> are destructive of=
 each other, dispersed
in the presence of Swamiji as darkness before the su=
n. Swamiji
was a tremendous worker because he was a <i>bhakta</i> and <i>jn=
ani</i>.
The tremendous energy that shook the whole world and is still
at w=
ork awakening many a slumbering soul to its innate Divinity,
instilling lif=
e into dead bones, bringing sunshine in the

darkness of despair and love i=
n dry, arid souls =E2=80=93, this
tremendous energy owes its origin to his =
realization of <i>brahman</i> in all.
Here too, I must tell you that the fa=
tally-erroneous idea that
<i>karma</i> is antagonistic to <i>jnana</i> and =
<i>bhakti</i> is dispelled at once
by the life of Swamiji.</div>

<div>I to=
ld you at the outset that before I met Swamiji I did not,
on account of my =
limited religious views, expect to see in him
anything of the warrior, the =
poet, the philosopher, or the
philanthropist. But I found that he was all t=
hese and more than
these. He was as much a poet as a philosopher; as much a=

sentimental visionary as a man of action. And he was all these,
not in spi=
te of his religion but on account of it.</div><div>

</div><div>I have lear=
nt that a religion which does not call forth into
vigorous activity and cha=
sten and elevate the moral,
intellectual, and aesthetic faculties of man, m=
ake him humane and
self-sacrificing and at the same lime self-absorbed and
=
meditative is an imperfect religion. But I have also learnt that even
such =
imperfect religions have their great purpose to serve in
helping the growth=
 of persons less evolved and that our
attitude towards them all should he o=
ne of extreme sympathy and
love. I have learnt that I should hesitate thric=
e before I
condemn any form of religious faith, however repellent it may
ap=
pear to me. For I have seen forms of worship, generally
condemned as supers=
titious, yield treasurers of infinite beauty
and holiness touched by the ma=
gic wand of Swamiji. I have
learnt that every individual, however degraded =
he may appear
in my eyes, is God involved, and therefore cannot be lost for=

ever. We should look upon him with respect and if possible
give him a lift=
 Godward, not by condemning his perverted
ideal and by cruelly tearing it a=
way from his heart but by gently
replacing it by a true one suited to his t=
emperament and
culture. I have learnt that under peculiar circumstances eve=
n
hardness and cruelty become a virtue, stubborn resistance.
and excellence=
, and that activity is as much a help to spiritual
growth as contemplative =
calmness. I have learnt that God can
be enjoyed both within ourselves and o=
utside of ourselves;
within ourselves by effacing completely from our consc=
iousness

all impression of the world of senses and making me
Spirit touch =
Spirit. Outside ourselves by seeing God in
everything and pouring out our h=
earts unto His feel in the shape of
loving service. I have learnt the incal=
culable value of great
personalities in the scheme of individual, national,=
 and
universal redemption. I have also learnt that I have learnt all these
=
only intellectually and am yet far from getting them woven
into my nature. =
And all these I have learnt from the life of
Swamiji. One thing more: My co=
nviction that Swamiji's
spiritual realization was of the highest order came=
 to me not only
from his intense purity, fearlessness, love of truth, and
u=
niversal sympathy, but also from those subtler personal
manifestations desc=
ribed in our <i>shastras</i>. I have seen him weep like a
child and becomin=
g disconsolate at the name of God. I have
seen him go into such deep medita=
tion that even the function
of the lungs stopped. Last of all came his own =
words to give the
finishing touch to my conception of his spiritual greatne=
ss....</div>
