Namaste,
Here's an extract from Yoga Vasistham that relates to the discussi=
on:
"The ignorant are trapped by the fruits of their actions on account of
=
their conditioning (vAsanAs). When the latter is given up, action
becomes n=
on-action, whether it is conventionally regarded as good or
evil.
In the ab=
sence of self-limitation or volition, action do not bear fruit.
Action by t=
hemselves do not generated reaction or fruits; it is the
vAsanAs or the vol=
ition that makes action bear fruit.
Enlightened men, though they may be con=
stantly engaged in activity, do
nothing: it is not by means of inaction tha=
t they reach the state of
non-action!
This very fact of non-action frees on=
e from experiences: for there is no
harvest where there is no sowing.
When =
thus both the notions of "I do" and "I experience" have ceased,
there remai=
ns only peace! When that peace is firmly grounded, there is
liberation."
~Y=
oga Vasistham

 But, if a pipe has a lot of heavy balls, your
