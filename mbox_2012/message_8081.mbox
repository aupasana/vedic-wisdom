Namaste,

"Another Q. - 2) I have sliced coconut copras and drying them for=
 last 
3-4 days, I can dry them no matter how long it takes, so that I can =
use 
them as suggested in the manual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dr=
y a "FULL" coconut so much that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, =
I am drying sliced coconuts... but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a=
 few days, will not it be rotten or something? Any procedure? I am 
asking =
this because here no one has any idea about that, because no one 
even thin=
ks of having "burnable" full coconuts. That is why."

My two cents :

To ma=
ke dry coconut you need heat more than the sunlight. Yes the coconut will r=
ot if you keep it outside in the sun for so long. 


I long back saw in Foo=
d TV in US.....he kept the whole coconut in conventional oven for one hour.=
 Then he broke the shell with a hammer. The shell came out easily and the w=
hole coconut stayed intact. 


I think once the shell comes out put the who=
le coconut in oven again, that way the water will dry out and you will get =
a dry coconut.=C2=A0 You can shake the coconut to see if there is water ins=
ide or not and accordingly experiment. 


Hope this works...good luck with =
your homams. Its amazing how god makes his devotees do homams even in musli=
m land. 


Best regards,
Priya

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] First homam experience=

 

=C2=A0 
Namaste Narasimha Ji and other members

I have performed a supe=
r-short Shani Homam this evening. I thank you for guiding me so detailed...=
 without your manual it would never be possible.

Interesting point to note=
, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a Brahmin family for =
about 10 days and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing homam! Ho=
wever I was disappoint because their procedure was so big that it would tak=
e about 3 hours for the homam, and many more materials also. Of course, the=
y learnt it from 'guru-kulam' and it was their own tradition. They are not =
a modern researcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who could compare many traditio=
ns, research on them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had no =
idea that a shorter version is possible, or something can be left out. As a=
n example, they suggested a mantadory japam of 10x times before I do an 'x'=
 times offering in homam, and many more formalities.

So, I knew in Banglad=
esh I would never have so much materials needed, and I would not be able to=
 perform a 3 hour homam regularly, so it was of no use. 

Much later when I=
 was reading your manual, I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc. from thei=
r teaching :-)

Anyway Ji...

Everything was almost as per recommendation, =
except I used a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I couldn't manage a w=
ooden spoon even after a lot of effort. May be I have to order it... but I =
will have to work much hard to find a craft-man who can make a spoon with w=
ood.

I burnt the fire with mango-wood and jute-sticks.

Purnahuti with ghe=
e only.

That WAS the problem. Soon after starting the fire, I had an idea =
how fast the woods were burning. So while I was moving with the homam, I kn=
ew that with a big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire will not survive=
 long to allow me meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods were burning out =
fast.

So I could not meditate.

My first Q. - 1) Would you have any sugges=
tion how can I make the fire last long so that it burns for at least 10 min=
s allowing me mediate? I noted even if I had put much wood, they would stil=
l burn out fast...

Offering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing=
 that would keep the fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me meditate.

Anothe=
r Q. - 2) I have sliced coconut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I=
 can dry them no matter how long it takes, so that I can use them as sugges=
ted in the manual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a "FULL" coconut =
so much that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced =
coconuts... but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not=
 it be rotten or something? Any procedure? I am asking this because here no=
 one has any idea about that, because no one even thinks of having "burnabl=
e" full coconuts. That is why.

Mantras work very strong for me. But I feel=
 not strong enough for big spiritual or material effects. I have had very s=
trong experiences with homam before while performing with others. Even a fe=
w times I *arranged* homams for others and I always directly felt a strong =
effect working on me also.

Today with the homam, the effect was not that s=
trong. I know why, because it was a super-short homam, with many mantras le=
ft. Also, I should honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lor=
d Shani Deva in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I w=
as worried and nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on t=
heir presence. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.

I am goi=
ng to add mantras from the main homam soon, common mantras which are needed=
 in all homams like Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I gu=
ess Avahana-related Sanskrit mantras are very important.

By the way I did =
108 offerings with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and then 21 offerings with the s=
mallest Shani mantra again.

I am thankful to the ultimate divinity that at=
 least I didn't have any negative experience after the homam. I was pretty =
nervous about the possibility. Because long back in 2002-2003 when I starte=
d mantras, almost everyday I faced negative energies for the imperfection o=
f pronunciation and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were so strong. But=
 I didn't give up and tried to understand the correct ways because since I =
saw the power in it, I had to find what's the right way to get the pure ble=
ssings, avoiding mistakes.

As an example, you [Narasimha Ji] instructed to=
 stay in an empty stomach while doing homam. I find this 100% true from my =
mantra japam experience. Though no website or almost no one instructed me t=
o stay empty stomached in japam, I found that mantras work very strong with=
 empty stomach. Also, I always got strong negative effects when I did japam=
 after my dinner. Thus, I learned this from my own experience but after a l=
ot of troubles faced [for the wrong practices I did]! Now days, I can't eat=
 anything after my lunch... because I do mantras in the evening. At times i=
t becomes very difficult not to eat something as I sometimes hang out with =
friends etc. at afternoon or early evening. But I have no choice.

That is =
the thing I appreciate about you [Narasimha Ji] to make the small [yet very=
 important] things always mentioned.

Same thing about your instruction of =
minimum movement of the body, I find it very correct.

Anyway Ji I guess I =
am stretching my mail very long...

my 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I =
take Shani as an expression of the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can=
 offer other Gods' mantras in fire too. Can I do a Navagraha homam this way=
, or at least a homam for 6-7 grahas?

4) If yes, should I maintain the gra=
ha order such as Surya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?

5) Is there any exception=
al instruction while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?=


Wanted to mention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and=
 other deities but manuals for those deities are already there, hence these=
 additional questions about graha-homams.

Appreciate your time to answer m=
e.

Thanking you again,
Tanvir
