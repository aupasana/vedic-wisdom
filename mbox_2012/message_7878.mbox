Dear scholars,
=A0
I=A0have a small doubt on priest's act i came across on =
shivrathri night in shiva temple in Dallas. They had planned to perform mah=
anyasa purvaka=A0ekadasa rudrabhishekam followed by 365 lingaarchana. There=
 were total 7 brahmins involved out of which two were reciting mahanysama. =
While reciting, one priest drank water from the copper vessel, and after ma=
hanysam is complete, he used the same water from the vessel that he drank, =
for pooja and perform all shodacha upachara samaskrams such as "suddhodaka =
snanam", arghyam, achamanam, etc to the maha linga. 
=A0
My question is, on=
ce the water has been drunk by priest, would it be wise to use same vessel =
water for pooja. i tried to convey him the message but he was not looking a=
t me, and i could not go near him and tell as there was too much crowd, but=
 did convey the message to the lady sitting next to me=A0 thinking that she=
 would relay the message as she knows him, (although she did not) as for so=
me reason i thought it is not correct to do.
=A0
Please clarify....
=A0
Reg=
ards,
Vasavi
