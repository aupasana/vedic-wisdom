Hello LaxmiNarayanji,

Thanks for the encouraging message. The thought of=
 Vishnu turning on his watery resting place and glancing in this direction =
is rather sweet. You've motivated me to do the mantra with even more enthus=
iasm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her for help with this......Ramakrish=
na says you have to keep tugging at Her sari till she gives you something v=
aguely worthwhile like devotion.

Very interesting to hear of your experien=
ce in Delhi. I agree that the Name provides protection against dodgy situat=
ions. I don't like to think about ghosts/spirits etc.... I'm embarrassed to=
 say that have always been scared of the dark since childhood, slowly getti=
ng over it now. 

Once at university, around 7 years ago, I was preparing f=
or some exams. It was after term-time and I had stayed back to revise.  I w=
as moved to a room that was different to the one I had been staying in, as =
my usual room was being used for some conference guests. I used to hang out=
 with the Hare Krishnas then, and was really into chanting the Hare Rama ma=
hamantra then (still love this mantra, but chant Om Namo Narayanaya more no=
w)- used to do 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. 

I was lying on my =
back in this new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in some sort of=
 light sleep state. At that point I had a very nasty sensation that can onl=
y be described as something or someone trying really hard to strangle me! I=
 felt very frightened, and couldn't move, speak or wake myself up.

In this=
 state, my mind started repeating "Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, Hari" very very f=
ast in terror. I think I chose this name because it was short and I could s=
ay it very fast with concentration! The frightening experience then passed =
and I felt the Name saved me.

I woke up and turned on the light feeling ab=
solutely petrified and unable to go back to sleep. I then did something I w=
ouldn't normally do. I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in London at that tim=
e of night (I knew they don't sleep till about midnight as I've stayed ther=
e) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Swami who initiated=
 me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm, she very kindly =
came to the phone and reassured me saying it could have been some real nega=
tive force or just something from my imagination. Either way, she reassured=
 me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repeating the Name was=
 the right approach. She suggested chanting before bedtime to avoid similar=
 experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra before going to =
bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the light though on because I'm a cow=
ard ;).

Since then, I keep up the practice of repeating the Name before be=
dtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings positive Divine =
energy to my mind ensuring better sleep. :)

Best wishes,

Aparna
