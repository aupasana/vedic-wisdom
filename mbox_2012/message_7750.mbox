I am trying to do fasting for sadhana purposes. I tried fasting on Ekadasi =
and could not stand missing any meal. Since I failed on Ekadasi day, I atte=
mpted on Pradosham day and ended up eating at 1 am, since I was not able to=
 sleep. Again I tried on Full Moon day and ended up in failure. 

Thankful =
if any one offers tips for fasting.
