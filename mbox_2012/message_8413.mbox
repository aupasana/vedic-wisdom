chant ram, krishna,allah,
wahe - guru,  or whatever name you so please, cha=
nt your mantra, because
who knows when that heart attack comes )

How bad d=
o you want God????

A modified version of a really popular audio. The modif=
ied version
applies a lot to us, fools lost in oblivion trying to learn mor=
e and
more and more theories instead of doing sadhana.

Quoted with modific=
ations pertaining to Mr God.

"""There was a young man, you know, who wante=
d to reach god/be super
siddha or something and so he went to this guru. Th=
e guru was very very
advanced, a legend in his own right. And he told the g=
uru you know I
wanna be on the same level you are and the guru said if you =
wanna be on
the same level I'm on, I'll met you tomorrow at the beach.

So =
the young man got there 4 A.M. he was  all ready to rock n' roll.
He was dr=
essed properly, but he should have worn shorts. The old man
grabs his hand =
and said: How bad do you wanna be successful (basically
achieve god, have s=
iddhi and the like, all references to success from
hereon now mean uniting =
with god) ? He said: "Real bad". He
said: Walk on out in the water. So he w=
alks out into the water. When he
walks out to the water he goes waist deep =
and goes like this old man is
crazy.

The young man was thinking , "Hey I w=
anna meet god, achieve siddhi in my
sadhana, get out of this birth death cy=
cle etc. etc. and this foolish
old man got me out here swimming. I didn't a=
sk to be a lifeguard. I
wanna meet god he got me in water =96 so the old ma=
n said go on a
little further =96 the young man walked out a little further=
 =96
then the young man was neck deep in water - the young man was thinking=
 
this old man is crazy =96 everybody calls him a paramhansa, a
mahapurusha=
, god incarnate but he is definitely crazy. So the old man
again said go on=
 out a little further =96 the young man went out a
little further, the wate=
r was now right at his mouth =96the young man
was now thinking of going bac=
k, this old hack is out of his fucking
mind. And then the old man said: "I =
thought you said you wanted to
be successful?" He said: "I do." He said: "T=
hen walk a
little further." Then the old man followed this guy into the wat=
er,
he grabbed the young man's head, and held him down underwater. The old
=
guy held the young man, till  the young man was about to pass out, the
youn=
g guys arms were now splashing the water in desperation, then
suddenly the =
guru raised him up. He said: "I got a question for
you." He told the young =
guy, he said: "When you want to succeed
as bad as you wanna breathe than yo=
u will be successful."
(Succeed =3D uniting with god, or seeing god, or ach=
ieving supernatural
powers, or siddhi, or whatever, thats subjective, upto =
you.)

I don't know how many of you all got asthma here in Vedic wisdom? If=

you ever had a asthma attack before, you are short of breath S.O.B,due
to =
shortness of breath, you start wheezing, "hai, hai, hai" like you
have run =
10,000kms in one go, the only thing you are trying to do at
that moment dur=
ing the attack, is get some air. You don't care about
no basketball game, y=
ou don't care about what's on T.V., you
don't care about nobody calling you=
, you don't care about a
party. The only thing you care about when you tryi=
ng to breathe is to
get some fresh air. That's it! And when you get to the =
point where
all you wanna do is be is successful as bad as you wanna breath=
e then
you will be successful. And I'm here to tell you that number one,
mo=
st of you say you wanna be successful but you don't want it bad,
you just k=
ind of want it. You don't want it bad than you wanna
party. You don't want =
it as much as you want to be cool. Most of you
don't want success as much a=
s you want sleep. """"""
(Again Success =3D uniting with god, or seeing god=
, or achieving
supernatural powers, or siddhi, or whatever, thats subjectiv=

you.)

Do all of you remember that Visa call from your perspective
embassies=
????
Remember those???
The interviews???
Even if you had slept at 4 in the =
morning, the night before, you would
still wake up and be at the embassy of=
fice at 7, or whenever your
appointment was.
Hell even if you had high feve=
r 102 or something, you would still reach.
Do you remember that flight to t=
he states???
Ohhhh Ammmerrriiiiicaaaaaaa!!!! You got up for that flight eve=
n after
like sleeping for 1 hour the night before. How????

Or do you remem=
ber that fancy restaurant??? Yes the one you waited for 1
hour, in heat , t=
o get in , to have the tasty tikkas??? Mmmmmmmmm,
tandoori chicken=85.. mmm=
mmm.

When was the last time you did this for god????
I see homams that las=
t for 15 minutes. Sure enough 15 is better than
zero, but still 15???
You c=
an spend hours on that superbowl match, finding porn on the
internet, downl=
oading movies, watching youtube, sleeping, talking,
bitching, gossiping, sh=
opping, and when it comes to god, you give 15
minutes. Wah, wah!!!!!

Surel=
y sire/ madame, god will be yours, yes, yes surely. Just like I'll
sleep wi=
th Miranda Kerr one day, you too will get god, no worries.

Ek baat batao, =
tumhare ko Mr PVR/pandit ke dwara itni badhiya homam
manuals pakraiee gayin=
, tumne kya kiya????? Tarpana manuals pakrayi
gayin, tumne kya kiya????
Tum=
ne inke upar intellectual discussion ki, lekin kaam naa kiya.
Tumne sari so=
 called spiritual texts toh par leen, internet se saara
maal chep liya, par=
 kiya kya?????????? Kuch nahin.

Did you start training your body to be sti=
ll and progressively increased
the time sitting of sitting idle while hanti=
ng????
Did you start on a celibacy drive????? No matter if you periodically=

fail.
Did you start managing your food intake????
Did you start chanting t=
he name of god as much as you can even after
reading this line a thousand t=
imes that death is the ultimate reality
and who knows when you die ????
How=
 many homams you did???Oh you dont have time do you?? But you seem to
have =
time for everything else in life.


Then what was the use for all the discu=
ssions because once your computer
is switched off, nothing changes in your =
life, your mind has made a
fuddu out of you by foxing you into thinking, "s=
ir I have done something
about my pitiable state."

Then you read Mr Nandy'=
s post about the story of "p", and say what an
eye opener, what excitement,=
 what a story!!!!!! But errrrrr=85=85=85=85
what did you do post that???

I=
 don't see people shortening their mall trips, their shopping sprees,
their=
 time on the internet but when it comes to a homam, first question
or thoug=
ht is "oh my gawd, it will take that long, let me ask Mr Rao of
making it s=
horter." And god is so magnanimous, he allows you to do so.

Hell you spend=
 more time on buying your kacche, panty, banyan and bras
rather than on god=
!!!!!! Wah, wah, surely god will be yours.

Then you pick up books, all sor=
t of books read all about other guys
reaching god, start reading into their=
 experiences, start discussing
about their high spiritual states and everyt=
hing, and get lost  in
arguing over those discussions. Then post apologies,=
 my goodness, the
noise. Waste of a human birth, if you were to see the lin=
e waiting for a
human womb, and then realize "I" have to stand at the end o=
f this line,
you would piss yourself. Some girl after seeing it did, and ha=
s always
been a little urgent with her sadhana ever since then.

I see this=
 question getting asked a lot, that "how do you find a
guru????"
And you kn=
ow everyone, wants a high powered one, not any other will do.
See a high po=
wered guru, also requires a good disciple.
Are you good enough, honestly an=
swer this??? Many will say no, many will
say good or not, its the guru's jo=
b to deal with it etc etc, but are you
willing to work on yourself to spare=
 the guru some work???? Why would a
high powered one come and teach you??? =
only after your penance is good
enough na? otherwise, he/she will be busy i=
n his/her union with god.


Now how bad do you want god?
How bad do you wan=
t a guru?
  How bad do you want those spiritual states?
How bad do you want=
 the darsahn for your beloved?

Don't kind of want it, want it bad, time is=
 running out, and very soon,
another rebirth, again the young age, again th=
e teenage, again the
affairs, again the hormone spikes, again the degrees, =
again the sucky
jobs, again confused with life, again the financial nightma=
res, again
the heart attacks , again the death, and again, again. Hai ram!!=
!!

I'll end this post with an example, a businessman in Delhi in the
1940'=
s, had done a bit of penance and you know was highly interested in
god , sh=
od and all this stuff. So one day , he had gone to kerala, and
met a guy wh=
o was proclaimed in the village to be equivalent to lord
voldmeort or somet=
hing but on the god side.

So the guy went to meet the guy whose name can't=
 be taken and asked him
, i am looking for a guru, the old fella said , for=
 what exactly are you
looking for a guru??? The business man said, , you kn=
ow to learn stuff.
The old fellow said what are you willing to do for your =
guru??? The
businessman said anything. The old fella said, okay take all yo=
ur
clothes off, the businessman was shocked. the suit guy took them off
rel=
uctantly. then the old fella, told him , wear a patta around your
neck and =
roam around the town naked. The businessman was aghast, but the
old fella, =
told him "anything right???", the businessman very BADLY
wanted a guru, so =
he went and got shoes thrown at him, came back after
half an hour to find t=
he old fella gone and his clothes gone too. He sat
there sobbing, and sobbi=
ng and cursing god, that i was the biggest fool
to come here and trust this=
 man. But then as he haid read somewhere, why
waste time, he started medita=
ting and chanted. 3 hours went by no sign
of the old man, 4 then 5 but by t=
he 6th, the old fella reappeared, and
said " here are your clothes, go back=
 to your town."

The businessman just didn't want to say anything tried to =
get up, but
couldn't move. The old fella was weeping with joy, stating that=
 finally
he has found someone worthy enough to teach. Somebody who actually=
 wants
it "bad".Old fella took the hotshot as his disciple.
