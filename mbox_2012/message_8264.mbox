Mr Gaurav,

To answer your question of "why chandi is feared and why should=
 we fear our own mother?"

Lets say, I come into your house, and break ever=
ything down in front of you. All the things you loved, all the things you c=
laimed to be yours, I take them and tear everything apart. I burn your IIIT=
 degree in front of you, and leave no trace of your very claim to be from I=
IIT.

I take your real estate papers and feed it to the dogs.

And then let=
s say I take your arm in my hand , and cut it off. And then I take the othe=
r and I cut it off. Then I take the blood that is pouring out and Drink it,=
 while you are still alive. And then I grab the back of your head and slash=
 it off. 

And this all happens on one fine Sunday morning without warning.=


Mr. Tripathi, I abolish all that is "Gaurav Tripathi" in your life, and m=
ake you realize who you truly are and merge your tiny blob of light into th=
e infinite light that is me, and I'll do it in the manner described above, =
are you willing to love me??
Are you willing to call me in your home??
Are =
you willing to wash my feet and drink the water??

Your eyes perceive that =
I have slashed your arms off, but in reality I have taken your karmas off, =
isn't that the best thing?

Your eyes perceive that I have destroyed everyt=
hing that you ever had, but what did you bring in the world when you were b=
orn?? Thus, by apparently destroying what you claim to be yours, haven't I =
broken an illusion of yours??

Your eyes perceive your death, but in realit=
y i am just taking my baby back whom i love.

The more attached you are to =
the false notion of "you", the more fierce she appears. But if after doing =
strenuous penance, you realize that "oh my gawd, all my life I have been id=
entifying with this and that, and that and this.", then she will appear to =
be the most loveliest being out there. Easy to type and easy to read, diffi=
cult to be at this stage.

Who says you are to fear your own mother? If you=
 truly surrender to your mother then she can do anything with your existenc=
e, right? After all she is your mother. 

This is why they say be careful w=
hile saying I surrender and do anything god but I only want you. Be prepare=
d then to do "anything".

Anyways keep on doing penance, its the only purpo=
se of this birth.

Jai girnari!!!

Warm Regards,
Nobody

 don't think that Chandi homam is the only homam for fast progress. Most hi=

 homam is capable of giving everything. Because we worship Ganapathi in the=

 and Chandi homam etc as the "full meal". That's not correct. Even Ganapath=
