Namaste Biswa ji,

All I meant was it is hard to perform hindu rituals in m=
uslim dominated countries and how god makes/helps his devotees do homams ev=
en in muslim land, that's all, there's no talk of discrimination here. 


W=
ith due respect may I request you to not draw harsh conclusions without cla=
rification. My mere intention was to help that's all. 


I realize, while w=
riting even though intentions are good if words are not framed properly it =
can cause negativity in people's mind. I shall refrain myself from posting =
further.=C2=A0 


My apologies if anyone else's sentiments have been hurted=
 too.=C2=A0
Good luck to all !!


Thank you,
Priya

Dear Tanvir Ji,

I can add some useful in=

1. In India, we kept the mature coconut in a =
dry place... over the time(3 to 6 months) the outside skin of the coconut b=
ecomes dry...

2. Full coconut(with skin) resembles the human head, burning=
 the full coconut resembles the burning of our ego(I-ness)

3. When the "ho=

g... In a small "homam kunda"... its really adventurious! :) simply... it w=

4. Whether dry or not, the coconut slice should burn beau=

Best of luck...

m my own experience but after a lot of troubles faced [for the wrong practi=
ces I did]! Now days, I can't eat anything after my lunch... because I do m=
antras in the evening. At times it becomes very difficult not to eat someth=
ing as I sometimes hang out with friends etc. at afternoon or early evening=
. But I have no choice.<br>

 - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani as an expression of the ultimate c=
osmic power or divinity, I can offer other Gods' mantras in fire too. Can I=
 do a Navagraha homam this way, or at least a homam for 6-7 grahas?<br>
>=
; <br>
> 4) If yes, should I maintain the graha order such as Surya, Cha=
ndra, Kuja and so on?<br>
> <br>
> 5) Is there any exceptional instru=
ction while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?<br>
>=
 <br>
> Wanted to mention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha La=
kshmi and other deities but manuals for those deities are already there, he=
nce these additional questions about graha-homams.<br>
