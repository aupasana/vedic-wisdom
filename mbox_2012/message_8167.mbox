Namaste,

I have, for more than a year now, been doing Shani homas every Sa=
turday. Doing a mantra of Shani, during sunset, after sunset and at night h=
as a relatively stronger effect than doing it when the sun is up in the sky=
, assuming everything else is constant. Of course for a very spiritually po=
werful person, anytime maybe fine, but night times do have a more pronounce=
d effect when worshiping Saturn, IMO.

-Regards

Respected Narasimhaji and Learned scholars,

I have a question on=
 shani's worship.This is not an astrological question. Currently, all the f=
our members of my family are running bad period such as Sade sati, arthasht=
ama sani and kantaka shani.

One of shani upasaka suggested to my husband t=
o perform shani Japa during night times at any place other than home. He st=
arts at about 10:00 PM, draws something on the floor and performs Japa for =
4-5 hrs and goes to temple next day morning before coming home. I am confus=
ed on this procedure.

my question is:

Why should we perform shani Japa at=
 night times only? I am suggesting him to do at day times in a shiva temple=
.
Is there a method for shani worship written in any scriptures?
Can we per=
form shani homa?

Please provide me some insights, as I am not comfortable =
with him performing Pooja at night times.

Thanks all
Vasavi
