Namaste Narasimha Ji

Thanks for your guidance. I have a few more things t=
o ask you.

1) Right after digbandhah, for some Gods like Hanumana, Sani et=
c. there is a small 'dhyanam' part. I was wondering whether I should recite=
 this loudly too, or just say this part inside my mind and meditate? (As it=
 says 'Dhyanam') But there is no different instructions given. 

I am sorry=
 to ask so many questions but Dhyanam is not there in Maha Ganapati Prana P=
ratisthapana, so I could not check from the video whether it is to be loudl=
y said, or just to meditate with it for a little while.

2) I understand th=
at when you're declaring the Rshi, you are indicating middle of the head. W=
hen chhandah, lips. When Devata, middle of the chest. And for the beejam an=
d (later) kilakam it's the same place you indicated... but is it navel (nab=
hi) you are indicating?

3) While declaring the shaktih, are you indicating=
 spine-base (kundalini)?

I am quite sure I perhaps will not be having anym=
ore questions about Prana Pratisthapana :-)

By the way, please don't addre=
ss me 'Ji'. Kindly call me by my name. I am much junior to you.

Regards
Ta=
nvir
