Namaste,

The ignorant are trapped by the fruits of their actions on accoun=
t of their conditioning (vaasanaas). When the latter is given up, action be=
comes non-action, whether it is conventionally regarded as good or evil.

I=
n the absence of self-limitation or volition, action do not bear fruit.

Ac=
tion by themselves do not generated reaction or fruits; it is the vaasanaas=
 or the volition that makes action bear fruit. 

Enlightened men, though th=
ey may be constantly engaged in activity, do nothing: it is not by means of=
 inaction that they reach the state of non-action! 

This very fact of non-=
action frees one from experiences: for there is no harvest where there is n=
o sowing.

When thus both the notions of "I do" and "I experience" have cea=
sed, there remains only peace! When that peace is firmly grounded, there is=
 liberation

, there remains only peace; when that peace is firmly grounded=
, there is liberation
