The Dalai Lama on his own reincarnation and the Tibetian method of recogniz=
ing reincarnated Lamas. 

http://www.tibetanbuddhistaltar.org/2011/09/state=
ment-of-his-holiness-the-fourteenth-dalai-lama-tenzin-gyatso-on-the-issue-o=
f-his-reincarnation/

One of the very interesting ideas he mentions is the =
difference between reincarnation and emanation in Buddhism, as well as the =
possibility in case of very High Boddhisatvas of having simultaneous and mu=
ltiple reincarnation. It the mind-stream that survives death and reincarnat=
es in a body.

"In some cases one high Lama may have several reincarnations=
 simultaneously, such as incarnations of body, speech and mind and so on."
