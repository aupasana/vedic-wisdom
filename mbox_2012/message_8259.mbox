Namaste,

Thank you!

Although I do not have any personal thoughts to share=
, Swami Krishnananda has penned some nice thoughts on this topic.

http://w=
ww.swami-krishnananda.org/upanishad/upan_14.html

Neat thing is that one ca=
n also listen to it (left hand corner on the webpage: "listen")

A nice web=
site, in general with a lot of e-books and audio/video lectures.

=C2=A0



  


    
      
      
      Namaste Rajarshi,=C2=A0What=
 you are describing is essentially evolution of gunas. What you call first =
stage is dominated by tamas, with some rajas too. What you call the second =
stage is dominated by rajas, with some tamas too. What you call the third s=
tage is dominated by satta, with some rajas too.=C2=A0This can be further b=
roken down as follows:=C2=A0(1) Mostly tamas: Does not think about spiritua=
l sadhana or progress. May fear god and go to temple or see/do poojas now a=
nd then.(2) Mostly tamas, with some rajas: Engages in some sadhana. But the=
 ignorance and attachments bring fears, worries, anxieties, doubts etc. As =
tamas reduces and rajas increases, doubts and fears are allayed to some ext=
ent, some direction is found and there is more focused effort.(3) Mostly ra=
jas, some tamas: Engages in a lot of sadhana, but still has some misconcept=
ions and doubts in mind. As tamas reduces, doubts and misconceptions reduce=
.(4) Mostly rajas, some sattwa: Engages in a
 lot of sadhana and focus and =
clarity of thinking starts to set in. As sattwa increases, one's thinking, =
vision and focus become clearer.(5) Mostly sattwa, some rajas: Weaknesses t=
hat troubled earlier start to trouble less and there is mental clarity. The=
re is still some passion, attachment and resultant internal stress (i.e. re=
sisting divine will or the fruits of previous karmas), which reduces as raj=
as reduces.(6) Mostly sattwa: Clear vision, nice focus of mind in sadhana, =
very good acceptance of divine will (fruits of previous karmas) and flowing=
 with the divine rhythm.=C2=A0There can be several other abstractions to lo=
ok at stages in sadhana. Vasishtha describes some in Yoga Vaasishtham.=C2=
=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0One important thing to note is that sadhana and spir=
itual progress are not something to flaunt. If one is in stage 2 or 3, it i=
s nothing to be ashamed of and one need not pretend otherwise. The most imp=
ortant thing is to be honest
 internally. If there are doubts and anxieties=
, there is no point in suppressing them. They should be addressed in the ea=
rnest. A proper and natural evolution of understanding comes with time to e=
veryone. Pretensions of being someone one is not and forceful suppression o=
f misunderstandings does not help in the long run.=C2=A0Secondly, one need =
not spend a fixed amount of time in each stage. Some people make fast progr=
ess and some people take more time. If God wills, one can become liberated =
in a second. So don't worry wherever you are in terms of these "stages".=C2=
=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0BTW, what you say of "external experiences" applies =
to "internal experiences" as well. After all, mind (especially an imaginati=
ve one) is capable of "manufacturing" over time whatever it fancies. Some e=
xperiences can be hallucinations. Even when not, they can reinforce some un=
needed conditioning. I am not just talking about beginners, but even highly=
 evolved
 sadhakas.=C2=A0For example, there have been several elevated yogi=
s claiming to be the reincarnations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. They may al=
l have genuinely believed it and not trying to deceive anyone. If one's min=
d nurtured a secret desire to be somebody important and if one likes Ramakr=
ishna, it is possible to experience an internal vision suggesting that one =
is a reincarnation of Ramakrishna.=C2=A0Let me give a subtler example. I wa=
s once discussing the meaning of "Mantra Pushpam" here (see http://groups.y=
ahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/7015). A learned yogi wrote to me that =
it was about denser elements dissolving in lighter elements as Kundalini as=
cends and denser elements coming back from lighter elements as Kundalini de=
scends. When I pointed out weaknesses in that interpretation, he told me th=
at that was the *vision* (internal experience) he got when he meditated wit=
h it. However, that absolutely does not add up. What is described in Mantra=
 Pushpam
 is not chain of X merging in Y, Y merging in Z, etc. Moreover, al=
l elements are not covered. Moreover, water is common, i.e. X lies in water=
, water lies in X; Y lies in water, water lies in Y, and so on. That is dif=
ferent from dissolution and creation of elements as happens when Kundalini =
ascends and descends.=C2=A0However, I can believe that that yogi may have i=
ndeed gotten the vision as he claimed. When one looks at a verse (or any ot=
her notion or idea), one's rational mind may consciously or sub-consciously=
 come up with an intellectual understanding. If an imaginative and focused =
mind meditates then, it may indeed experience a corresponding vision! It is=
 all a play of mind and of no significance. Not every internal experience o=
f even an elevated yogi who genuinely experienced aspects of divine (but no=
t yet liberated) may mean something.=C2=A0Knowing which internal experience=
 is a result of some conditioning, some desire or some rational/emotional n=
otion
 still present in the mind, is not easy, even for good and sincere sa=
dhakas.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0External and internal experiences cannot=
 be avoided as one does sadhana. Depending on one's conditioning, one may e=
xperience many things.=C2=A0Whether an experience is external or internal i=
s not IMHO the main thing. Both can be useful in some cases and increase fa=
ith and confidence or give clarity of thinking, and trigger positive intern=
al transformation. Both can be detrimental in some cases and increase pride=
 or reinforce some wrong notions, and delay positive internal transformatio=
n or even trigger negative internal transformation.=C2=A0Vasishtha's guidan=
ce is very clear. Neither seek nor avoid experiences (which are like roadsi=
de trees as one travels on a hilly road to the top of the hill). Keep the m=
ind focused on sadhana to the best of your ability.=C2=A0Though I said it b=
efore, I will say this again, because it is worth saying many times:=C2=A0T=
he
 only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and the only experience w=
orth longing is the internal experience of detachment. If one experiences l=
ess stress in situations that would've stressed one before, if one experien=
ces less anger in situations that would've angered one before, if one exper=
iences less lust in situations that would've made one lusty before, if one =
experiences less jealosy in situations that would've made one jealous befor=
e, and so on, then one is making progress.=C2=A0Best regards,Narasimha-----=

Three stages of sadhana, as I see it. Purely my own observation=
s. Not points of debate. Everyone is free to disagree. 
1st stage of Sadhan=
a: Try out scoops of everything, hanging on to solicited or unsolicited adv=
ice from anywhere and everwhere, and eventually moving in confused circles,=
 feeling proud and happy about the fact that, yes I am doing something call=
ed sadhana while many others are not. The mind lies in the communal stage (=
communal =3D anyone one who mentally identifies to a community not necessar=
ily in a religious sense), trying to find a community of similar minded ind=
ividuals and hang on to the same in a subconscious attempt to define itself=
. 
2nd stage of Sadhana: Get bits and pieces of "experiences" in an externa=
l format which the mind correlates to the process of sadhana and either fee=
ls happy, or dejected. Soon it gets boring, for none of these so called ext=
ernal "experiences" are consistent or even replicable at will. Doubts start=
 creeping, boredom sets in, confusions galore, and some fall back to stage =
1 described above. 
3rd stage: One realizes the absolute futility of the ex=
ternal experiences compared to what is happening inside, if at all anything=
 is happening. Until a transformation process triggers inside the mind, all=
 of it is meaningless. The external world may crack open and 33 millions de=
ities may dance infornt, yet it eventually counts for nothing if it is not =
able to still the "monkey-mind" and make the sadhaka enjoy a concentrated f=
eeling of internal joy. This joy will overflow into other secular activitie=
s and thoughts, it's so powerful and dynamic in nature. One who is firmly e=
stablished in this stage, will never bother too much about the external rit=
ual, its source, its accuracy etc. He/she does not shun external rituals, b=
ut he/she realizes that the real barometer for judging the efficacy of a sa=
dhana is inside the mind and heart. This is the beginning of the "alone" ph=
ase. Alone, but not lonely. In loneliness one craves for external validatio=
n, in being
 alone one needs no validation apart from his/her own joy. 
As =
such, if this person were to meet another sadhaka, the only worthy informat=
ion he/she will try to extract is what has the other person experienced int=
ernally, and be least bothered about what path he/she walks and which deity=
 he/she is trying to worship. Fancy names and theoretical classifications d=
o not impress him/her anymore. 
>From here starts the real journey. Before t=
hat, stage 1 and stage 2 is like a kindergarten attitude. So each sadhaka m=
ust ask himself/herself objective, where does he/she stand and where is he/=
she headed!

When I pointed out weaknesses in that interpretation, he told me that that =
was the *vision* (internal experience) he got when he meditated with it. Ho=
wever, that absolutely does not add up. What is described in Mantra Pushpam=
 is not chain of X merging in Y, Y merging in Z, etc. Moreover, all element=
s are not covered. Moreover, water is common, i.e. X lies in water, water l=
ies in X; Y lies in water, water lies in Y, and so on. That is different fr=
om dissolution and creation of elements as happens when Kundalini ascends a=
