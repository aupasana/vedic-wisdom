I believe that it doesn't matter if you perform homam for 3hrs or 3 mins an=
d with many materials or little materials. Minimum things are always requir=
ed.All it matters is the concentration and belief in performing homam and o=
n GOD. We pray GOD with fear and not with belief and love. 
There is always=
 a mantra in the end 'Kriya heenam...', which says 'Oh Lord please excuse u=
s for wrong doing by ignorance and materialize our offerings'. 
Performing =
japam for 10X times is to please GOD. Each GOD has their unique way of plea=
sing them. Doing homam in such short cut ways might not give desired result=
s though in many cases it doesn't harm.

N=
amaste Narasimha Ji and other members

I have performed a super-short Shani=
 Homam this evening. I thank you for guiding me so detailed... without your=
 manual it would never be possible.

Interesting point to note, that in Dec=
 of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a Brahmin family for about 10 days=
 and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing homam! However I was d=
isappoint because their procedure was so big that it would take about 3 hou=
rs for the homam, and many more materials also. Of course, they learnt it f=
rom 'guru-kulam' and it was their own tradition. They are not a modern rese=
archer like you [Narasimha Ji] who could compare many traditions, research =
on them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had no idea that a s=
horter version is possible, or something can be left out. As an example, th=
ey suggested a mantadory japam of 10x times before I do an 'x' times offeri=
ng in homam, and many more formalities.

So, I knew in Bangladesh I would n=
ever have so much materials needed, and I would not be able to perform a 3 =
hour homam regularly, so it was of no use. 

Much later when I was reading =
your manual, I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc. from their teaching :-=
)

Anyway Ji...

Everything was almost as per recommendation, except I used=
 a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I couldn't manage a wooden spoon e=
ven after a lot of effort. May be I have to order it... but I will have to =
work much hard to find a craft-man who can make a spoon with wood.

I burnt=
 the fire with mango-wood and jute-sticks.

Purnahuti with ghee only.

That=
 WAS the problem. Soon after starting the fire, I had an idea how fast the =
woods were burning. So while I was moving with the homam, I knew that with =
a big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire will not survive long to allo=
w me meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods were burning out fast.

So I c=
ould not meditate.

My first Q. - 1) Would you have any suggestion how can =
I make the fire last long so that it burns for at least 10 mins allowing me=
 mediate? I noted even if I had put much wood, they would still burn out fa=
st...

Offering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing that would k=
eep the fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me meditate.

Another Q. - 2) I h=
ave sliced coconut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I can dry them=
 no matter how long it takes, so that I can use them as suggested in the ma=
nual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a "FULL" coconut so much that =
it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced coconuts... b=
ut if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be rotten=
 or something? Any procedure? I am asking this because here no one has any =
idea about that, because no one even thinks of having "burnable" full cocon=
uts. That is why.

Mantras work very strong for me. But I feel not strong e=
nough for big spiritual or material effects. I have had very strong experie=
nces with homam before while performing with others. Even a few times I *ar=
ranged* homams for others and I always directly felt a strong effect workin=
g on me also.

Today with the homam, the effect was not that strong. I know=
 why, because it was a super-short homam, with many mantras left. Also, I s=
hould honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva =
in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I was worried an=
d nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on their presence=
. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.

I am going to add man=
tras from the main homam soon, common mantras which are needed in all homam=
s like Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I guess Avahana-r=
elated Sanskrit mantras are very important.

By the way I did 108 offerings=
 with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and then 21 offerings with the smallest Shani=
 mantra again.

I am thankful to the ultimate divinity that at least I didn=
't have any negative experience after the homam. I was pretty nervous about=
 the possibility. Because long back in 2002-2003 when I started mantras, al=
most everyday I faced negative energies for the imperfection of pronunciati=
on and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were so strong. But I didn't giv=
e up and tried to understand the correct ways because since I saw the power=
 in it, I had to find what's the right way to get the pure blessings, avoid=
ing mistakes.

As an example, you [Narasimha Ji] instructed to stay in an e=
mpty stomach while doing homam. I find this 100% true from my mantra japam =
experience. Though no website or almost no one instructed me to stay empty =
stomached in japam, I found that mantras work very strong with empty stomac=
h. Also, I always got strong negative effects when I did japam after my din=
ner. Thus, I learned this from my own experience but after a lot of trouble=
s faced [for the wrong practices I did]! Now days, I can't eat anything aft=
er my lunch... because I do mantras in the evening. At times it becomes ver=
y difficult not to eat something as I sometimes hang out with friends etc. =
at afternoon or early evening. But I have no choice.

That is the thing I a=
ppreciate about you [Narasimha Ji] to make the small [yet very important] t=
hings always mentioned.

Same thing about your instruction of minimum movem=
ent of the body, I find it very correct.

Anyway Ji I guess I am stretching=
 my mail very long...

my 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani as=
 an expression of the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can offer other =
Gods' mantras in fire too. Can I do a Navagraha homam this way, or at least=
 a homam for 6-7 grahas?

4) If yes, should I maintain the graha order such=
 as Surya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?

5) Is there any exceptional instructio=
n while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?

Wanted to m=
ention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and other deitie=
s but manuals for those deities are already there, hence these additional q=
uestions about graha-homams.

Appreciate your time to answer me.

Thanking =
you again,
Tanvir
