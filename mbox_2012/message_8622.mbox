Serving humanity and japa/havan go nicely hand-in-hand. Service of humanity=
 is bhakti....serving the living God. If one loves God, how can one stand t=
o see him suffer in the form of man? One can mentally do japa while serving=
 humanity, which is what all the saints advise. 

Sivananda says:

"To beho=
ld the one Self in all beings is Jnana, wisdom; to love the Self in all bei=
ngs is Bhakti, devotion; to serve the Self in all beings is Karma, action."=


He suggests the Yoga of Synthesis i.e. combining bhakti, jnana and karma =
yoga for all round development of the heart, head and hand of man. 

Best w=
ishes,

Aparna
