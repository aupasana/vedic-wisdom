Namaste to all

Recently i have tried to use a bigger havan kund in compari=
son to the one i was using earlier.
How do you offer 'Bali' when the flames=
 are leaping high and when try to offer bali at position 1,5,6 chances of y=
our getting burned are very high. Earlier i didnt face any trouble beacuse =
the fire used to be small

Regards
Jitender
