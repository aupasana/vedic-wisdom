"The Adam and Eve story is incomprehensible to me!" I observed with conside=
rable heat one day in my early struggles with the allegory. 

"Why did God =
punish not only the guilty pair, but also the innocent unborn generations?"=


Master was more amused by my vehemence than my ignorance. "GENESIS is dee=
ply symbolic, and cannot be grasped by a literal interpretation," he explai=
ned. "Its 'tree of life' is the human body. The spinal cord is like an uptu=
rned tree, with man's hair as its roots, and afferent and efferent nerves a=
s branches. The tree of the nervous system bears many enjoyable fruits, or =
sensations of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. In these, man may righ=
tfully indulge; but he was forbidden the experience of sex, the 'apple' at =
the center of the bodily garden. 

"The 'serpent' represents the coiled;up =
spinal energy which stimulates the sex nerves. 'Adam' is reason, and 'Eve' =
is feeling. When the emotion or Eve;consciousness in any human being is ove=
rpowered by the sex impulse, his reason or Adam also succumbs. 

"God creat=
ed the human species by materializing the bodies of man and woman through t=
he force of His will; He endowed the new species with the power to create c=
hildren in a similar 'immaculate' or divine manner. Because His manifestati=
on in the individualized soul had hitherto been limited to animals, instinc=
t;bound and lacking the potentialities of full reason, God made the first h=
uman bodies, symbolically called Adam and Eve. To these, for advantageous u=
pward evolution, He transferred the souls or divine essence of two animals.=
 

In Adam or man, reason predominated; in Eve or woman, feeling was ascend=
ant. Thus was expressed the duality or polarity which underlies the phenome=
nal worlds. Reason and feeling remain in a heaven of cooperative joy so lon=
g as the human mind is not tricked by the serpentine energy of animal prope=
nsities.

"The human body was therefore not solely a result of evolution fr=
om beasts, but was produced by an act of special creation by God. The anima=
l forms were too crude to express full divinity; the human being was unique=
ly given a tremendous mental capacity;the 'thousand;petaled lotus' of the b=
rain;as well as acutely awakened occult centers in the spine.

"God, or the=
 Divine Consciousness present within the first created pair, counseled them=
 to enjoy all human sensibilities, but not to put their concentration on to=
uch sensations. These were banned in order to
avoid the development of the =
sex organs, which would enmesh humanity in the inferior animal method of pr=
opagation. The warning not to revive subconsciously;present bestial memorie=
s was not heeded. 

Resuming the way of brute procreation, Adam and Eve fel=
l from the state of heavenly joy natural to the original perfect man.
"Know=
ledge of 'good and evil' refers to the cosmic dualistic compulsion. Falling=
 under the sway of MAYA through misuse of his feeling and reason, or Eve;an=
d Adam;consciousness, man relinquishes his right to enter the heavenly gard=
en of divine self;sufficiency. The personal responsibility of every human b=
eing is to restore his 'parents' or dual nature to a unified harmony or Ede=
n."

As Sri Yukteswar ended his discourse, I glanced with new respect at th=
e pages of GENESIS.

"Dear Master," I said, "for the first time I feel a pr=
oper filial obligation toward Adam and Eve!"
