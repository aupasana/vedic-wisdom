Subject: Homam in the kitchen while standing

Dear all,

I'm afraid I have a very stupid question. Is it okay to do homam=
 while standing up? 

I once did a very simple homam while cooking. While t=
he food cooked for 20-30 minutes, I muttered the mantras and tended to a sm=
all homam kunda (basically a brass bowl, with some wooden sticks and ghee a=
nd basil leaf offerings) that I placed on the table next to the cooking foo=
d. 

It was a very pleasant experience. Far from feeling distracted, the si=
mplicity of the whole process made it easier for me to focus on the mantra.=
 

The key thing is I could do this sort of a homam every day, as I cook mo=
st days. And my family would not complain that I am spending too much time =
away from them doing spiritual things. (It might even give the food a bette=
r flavour as people say that food cooked while repeating mantras with feeli=
ng absorbs the mantra...who knows!)

I am thinking of doing an ultra simple=
 homam while standing in the kitchen. Please tell me if you think this is a=
gainst the scriptures, as I wouldn't want to do it if so.

I know people sa=
y feeling is more important that ritual. This homam procedure gives me a pr=
etty good feeling. I'm planning to give it a try again and see how it feels=
. I was wondering if there is anything in the scriptures that forbids doing=
 homam standing up? If I can generate concentration and feeling while stand=
ing and doing the homam, surely it will be equally effective (I hope so any=
way). 

Thanks very much in advance. Sorry if it sounds silly! 

Aparna

P.=
S. I am doing a weekly homam the 'proper' way i.e. sitting down and focussi=
ng. Just wanted to do a daily one and this would be the best way for me rig=
ht now. I have read the Agnihotra homam can be done "anywhere" so wondering=
 about other homams.
