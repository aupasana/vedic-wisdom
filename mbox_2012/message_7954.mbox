Namaste,

A minor point here.

<<who take care of the triple task of creati=
on, sustenance and destruction.>>


The interpretation that we have of deit=
ies, that one creates, one destroys, one sustains, or one is angry, (Kali) =
or such is based on *our* perspective, not theirs. For a deity, there is on=
ly one motivation and that is doing the right thing at the right time with =
literally zero attachment. Because each deity is a living example of the pe=
rfection in detached execution of their own dharmas, Nature accords them va=
st roles in its grand design. That is why each of them are actually capable=
 of doing everything. A Deity does, what it must do at that specific point =
in time. That's all.


-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

isdom] Hierarchy in Hinduism
 

=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir and everyone,

We are t=
rying to prepare a chart to explain to teenagers and children in our place,=
 the hierarchy of God and beings as taught by hinduism. 

For this, we have=
 parabrahman or the formless God at the beginning. Parabrahman takes the 6 =
forms of higher deities like athi parashakti, narayana, shiva, ganapathi, e=
tc as taught by Shankara. Below these we have the trinity representing the =
trigunas, Brahma-Vishnu-Rudra, who take care of the triple task of creation=
, sustenance and destruction. Below them we have the Gods beginning with In=
dra and the remaining 33 main devas referenced in the vedas. 

Please advis=
e and correct us if our understanding regarding this is proper.

Our furthe=
r questions which we need some light from everyone else is:
1) Where do oth=
er beings and demigods like Gandharva, Yaksha, Kinnaras, Apsaras, feature i=
n the scheme of things in this hierarchy. Other than those 4 I mentioned ar=
e there other types of beings?

2) Where do Rishis and Manushya feature in =
the scheme of things in the same hierarchy?

3) How about Pishaachas, and o=
ther beings? 

Please offer any information you can on this for us.

Pranam=
s,
Anoop.
