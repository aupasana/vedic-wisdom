Srimade Ramanujaya Namah:


Hi Rchalla,

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=
 Everybody goes through this kind of mentality sometimes, may be in your ca=
se its a bit too strong. The very fact that you are upset about this shows =
that you also have faith. Many people don't even care about such thoughts t=
owards Gods and consider them mere fancies or rather unimportant, which cal=
ls into question their very faith.=C2=A0
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0But the=
re is no need to worry. When the mind gets purified, the dirt has to come o=
ut. When you put chlorine in water, the impurities in the water starts to f=
loat as froth. Keep praying intensely and very sincerely. Humility is very =
important when in prayer. Apart from prayer, also please recite stotras whe=
never possible. Stotras are effective in getting rid of disturbing thoughts=
. A disciplined lifestyle also helps.
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 The whole idea i=
s to realize the non-existence of mind. As long as there are a million thou=
ghts, the thought of the existence of the mind also stays. This is because =
of years and years of conditioning of the mind. Many western religions focu=
s on conditioning the mind, whereas the Sanatana dharmic way stresses on de=
conditioning the mind. :)
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 When the mind is totally focussed o=
n one thought or mantra or stotra, the other thoughts slowly subside. Final=
ly the thought of the mantra (stotra) also goes away. So don't give too muc=
h importance to the bad thoughts.
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Be relaxed and cool =
and keep praying and reciting.

=C2=A0 
Respected NARASIMHA ji and ot=
her learned scholar,

I am posting my condition with a hope of getting some=
 relief and solution. Kindly do not judge me based on my condition, rather =
give me some positive solution and perspective to what I am going through.
=

I am a very strong beloved of god and a very strong devotee. I love to wor=
ship him as much as I can.however, all my passion, interest seems to get dr=
ained and discouraged due to my mindset and the hell I go through because o=
f it. I always , always get negative & abusive thoughts and tie those to th=
e god. For ex, if I hear a foul language, see a negative thing, bad or foul=
 my mind relates or ties it to god. My mind start abusing god with the same=
 foul language.
When I do Japam, =C2=A0my mind would not get concentration,=
 but goes into this evil mode with racing thoughts.
I can't see directly in=
to the eyes of god with the fear of my mind abusing him I can't focus my dr=
ishti on god statues. My thoughts are extremely foul...most specially foul =
language. However, I battle my thoughts with my worship, which means I don'=
t give up praying him. I requested him several times to relive me from such=
 pain so that I can increase my devotion and prayers. I love him. I want to=
 pray him.=C2=A0
Currently, my mind and it's racing evil & foul thoughts ha=
ve become a road block in my devotion and trying to keep me away from him a=
s much as possible. At one point of time, they dominated me and I had to st=
ay away from praying him for a while.

Now my questions are
Am I a Maha pap=
i or ghora papi that this is happening to me?
Why does it happen to me?
Is =
it some kind of disorder
Am in incurring wrath of god=C2=A0
I am scared to =
death that I am accumulating the greatest sin enough for some 100 births
Wh=
at can I do to get out of this perversion and be able to concentrate on him=

I want to worship god like every one does
I am highly stressed because of =
this constant battle. My forehead area, jaws are always in pain because of =
this stress.

Please help me , but do no hate me. Please do not disregard o=
r discard my email. This is a situation I can't disclose to anyone in perso=
n with the fear of hatred and resentment. I am hoping to get some relief fr=
om learned scholars like yourself.
