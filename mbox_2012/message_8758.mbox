Namaste friends,
=A0
For some deities, there are saattwik, raajasik and taa=
masik dhyana shlokas (contemplation verses). Please feel free to use whatev=
er dhyana shloka your guru recommends to you or you feel attracted to. I wi=
ll just make a generic philosophical comment. If it makes no sense, please =
ignore my 2 cents.

=
Dhyana shloka means a verse used for contemplating a deity. You use it to c=
reate a visualization in the mind, so that you visualize that form as you m=
editate later.
=A0
One person I know wanted to worship a specific deity. He=
 was so attracted to a specific picture of that deity and felt much love. H=
e wanted to worship that deity. He found a mantra and a few dhyana shlokas.=
 He asked me which dhyana shlokas will be better. I saw that none of them d=
escribed the form in the specific picture he was so attracted to. So I told=
 him it does not matter and pick whatever you want.
=A0
If one is able to p=
ick a dhyana shloka that describes a form one is able to mentally visualize=
 well, that is useful. Otherwise, if one mechanically reads a specific Sans=
krit verse and imagines something else mentally, it is simply a broken prac=
tice or a formality. If one throws out the dhyana shloka and simply describ=
es the form of interest in English or Hindi mentally, constructs that form =
on mind and moves on, it may be as effective!

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=

=A0
Some people are so concerned about picking a sa=
attwik, raajasik or taamasik dhyana shloka based on their perception of the=
ir guna.
=A0
Suppose a taamasik person imagines a supposedly saattwik form =
that is described as a pleasant and fair lady in white clothes radianting b=
right light. He may be thinking in the mind "it is easy to get what I want =
from Her. She is nice and gentle and will not give me any troubles. She sta=
nds for prospertity and will make me prosperous" etc. Basically, he wants t=
hings from Her and thoughts in his mind are of a taamasik nature, though th=
e form being imagined is supposed to be of saattwik symbols.
=A0
Now, suppo=
se a saattwik person imagines a supposedly taamasik form that is described =
as a fierce naked black lady jumping around uncontrollably and making loud =
sounds. He may be thinking in the mind "ah, She represents the primordial e=
nergy at the early stages of creation. This raw energy is mysterious, uncon=
ditioned and uncontrollable. Let me marvel at how this elaborate Creation c=
omes from that raw energy". Basically, thoughts in his mind are of a saattw=
ik nature, though the form being imagined is supposed to be of taamasik sym=
bols.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The condition=
ing in the mind - one's wants, likes and dislikes - determine whether one i=
s saattwik (in a steady state of purity and clarity), raajasik (in an unste=
ady state of flux and change), taamasik (in a steady state of impurity and =
confusion).
=A0
A very unruly kid can anger even a gentle mother. A sweet, =
nice and calm kid can make even a very fierce and agressive mother smile (i=
magine a fierce mother yelling loud at a baby and baby thinking it is funny=
 and laughing. Won't the mother mother laugh too?).
=A0
Though using a form=
 compatible with one's guna may be useful, people are not good at estimatin=
g their guna correctly. So, even if they worship a sattwik form, they end u=
p superimposing their rajas and tamas on that deity and on their sadhana. S=
o, the sadhana ends up being rajasik or saattwik, even though the deity and=
 sadhana may be made up of saattwik symbols.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Bottomline: What determines the guna of your sa=
dhana is your state of mind rather than the deity used and the symbols used=
 in sadhana.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
