Dear Utpal,

Agreed -:)

If we do not forget the parameters of judgement, t=
hen sadhana is fruitful, IMO. Otherwise it does not help. And the only para=
meters of judgement is to objectively see what changes are happening in our=
 surface, day-to-day consciousness.That is are we less angry, more equanimo=
us, etc etc.

The field of experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - =
is VAST. Some of it can be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex =
study in itself. Most spiritual people have never gone in depth trying to a=
nalyse and understand these things properly, but some pattern is observable=
.=C2=A0 Not all experiences are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost =
themselves in this jungle of experiences, not being able to adequately dete=
rmine which is genuine and which is non-genuine. This is the world of astra=
l plane, driven by the overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of =
manomayakosha of a human being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by =
the overlapping influence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to=
 anahata. Everything=C2=A0 is possible here. Every higher deity has a corre=
sponding lesser manifestation in this realm, but limited in ability. Simila=
rly there are endless beings of varies character and hue who can very easil=
y create an
 expereince for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They =
can even fake an experience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, t=
ake hold of a seeker and use him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole w=
ide world, the lower extreme of which causes, in a normal human being, a ce=
menting of a surface ego driven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal s=
ub-conscious ambitions, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust su=
ppressed) etc etc and at the other extreme this layer can, if properly chan=
nalized as is done in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience D=
ivine Ananda and manifest the "antaratmah" as an unfailing guide to the pat=
h.

In a nutshell, a genuine "experience" is good and authentic only to the=
 extent that it helps to modify and transform your waking surface personali=
ty. That is the only true test. Rest all the range of experiences that come=
 from this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this re=
alm, are just sound and fury without substance. 

In the writings of Sri Au=
robindo, he calls it the intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable=
 yogis who have got swept away by the light and sound of this realm. One su=
re-shot way to cross this realm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this s=
ome day, is to hang on tightly to the fundamentals.

-Regards

Dear Rajarshi,

A sage "sms" indeed! Yes direction must be always, alw=
ays the top most priority. It reminded me of simple, yet quite effective da=
y to day example of driving Car. One can not miss/ignore the sight of corre=
ct road to the destination even for a split second. However, Optimised "con=
trolled" speed (even if very fast by set standards) could be an added advan=
tage while not loosing the sight of the road.

Best Regards,

Utpal
